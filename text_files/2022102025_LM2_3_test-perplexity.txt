"Their conduct has been such," replied Elizabeth, "as neither you, nor
I, nor any body, can ever forget	4581.1591
--Elizabeth instantly read her feelings, and at that moment
solicitude for Wickham, resentment against his enemies, and every thing
else gave way before the hope of Jane's being in the fairest way for
happiness	1160.0597
Collins! my dear Charlotte,--impossible!"

The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her
story, gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a
reproach; though, as it was no more than she expected, she soon
regained her composure, and calmly replied,

"Why should you be surprised, my dear Eliza?--Do you think it incredible
that Mr	25.6447
I quite detest the man	2259.7841
"You have no regard, then, for the honour and credit of my nephew!
Unfeeling, selfish girl! Do you not consider that a connection with you,
must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody?"

"Lady Catherine, I have nothing farther to say	92860.8806
Her figure was elegant, and she walked well;--but Darcy, at
whom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly studious	12372.5067
"

"I do, I do like him," she replied, with tears in her eyes, "I love him	253.6179
They have each their
advantages, and I can be equally happy in either	1260.0184
Though suspicion was very far
from Miss Bennet's general habits, she was absolutely incredulous here	759.1091

Gardiner's
long letter, but now, having _that_ to communicate which she knew would
be most welcome, she was almost ashamed to find, that her uncle and aunt
had already lost three days of happiness, and immediately wrote as
follows:

     "I would have thanked you before, my dear aunt, as I ought to have
     done, for your long, kind, satisfactory, detail of particulars; but
     to say the truth, I was too cross to write	2057.5308
They could
not be untouched by his politeness, and had they drawn his character
from their own feelings, and his servant's report, without any reference
to any other account, the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known,

"I will not trust myself on the subject," replied Wickham, "_I_ can
hardly be just to him	41682.0167
When he was gone, they were certain at least of receiving constant
information of what was going on, and their uncle promised, at parting,
to prevail on Mr	6313.0565

Bennet's leaving them together, after a
longer irritation than usual about Netherfield and its master, she could
not help saying,

"Oh! that my dear mother had more command over herself; she can have no
idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him	346.3824
I longed to
know whether he would be married in his blue coat	30290.7935

feared that the master of the house might be amongst them; and whether
she wished or feared it most, she could scarcely determine	15144.1222

"

"_You_ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room," said Mr	20797.8310
Gardiner, whose curiosity
as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive	1350.0018
Hurst had therefore nothing to do, but to stretch himself on one of the
sophas and go to sleep	675.5913
Gardiner would be prevented by business from
setting out till a fortnight later in July, and must be in London again
within a month; and as that left too short a period for them to go so
far, and see so much as they had proposed, or at least to see it with
the leisure and comfort they had built on, they were obliged to give up
the Lakes, and substitute a more contracted tour; and, according to the
present plan, were to go no farther northward than Derbyshire	1952.0126

Gardiner and the children were to remain in Hertfordshire a few
days longer, as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to
her nieces	3769.5550
But, perhaps his sister does as well
for the present, and, as she is under his sole care, he may do what he
likes with her	3276.6558
Bennet, "but it is a comfort to think that, whatever of
that kind may befal you, you have an affectionate mother who will always
make the most of it	1564.4953
Collins would have led them round his two meadows,
but the ladies not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white
frost, turned back; and while Sir William accompanied him, Charlotte
took her sister and friend over the house, extremely well pleased,
probably, to have the opportunity of shewing it without her husband's
help	2160.8785
I came to try you	6743.6319
W	1.0000
After a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with

"It is _your_ turn to say something now, Mr	19609.6467
March was to take
Elizabeth to Hunsford	23421.3202
"

"He is a sweet tempered, amiable, charming man	8932.0372
Morris immediately; that he is
to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be
in the house by the end of next week	1298.4746
Had he done his duty in that
respect, Lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle, for whatever of
honour or credit could now be purchased for her	17851.9040
"

"It is more than I engage for, I assure you	11635.6402
The
subject was pursued no farther, and the gentlemen soon afterwards went
away	1514.6807
But now she would no longer
conceal from her, his share in Lydia's marriage	53813.9582
--The envelope itself was likewise
full	123.0807
He heard her attentively, and then said,

"Lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public
place or other, and we can never expect her to do it with so little
expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present
circumstances	3320.6303
Wickham	242955402.4908
And it is the more to be lamented, because there is reason to
     suppose, as my dear Charlotte informs me, that this licentiousness
     of behaviour in your daughter, has proceeded from a faulty degree
     of indulgence, though, at the same time, for the consolation of
     yourself and Mrs	2517.8405
"

Then turning to Mr	63567.7857
Bingley comes, my dear," said Mrs	635.0795
From the farther disadvantage of Lydia's
society she was of course carefully kept, and though Mrs	658.5301
--The
possibility of his having really endured such unkindness, was enough to
interest all her tender feelings; and nothing therefore remained to be
done, but to think well of them both, to defend the conduct of each, and
throw into the account of accident or mistake, whatever could not be
otherwise explained	1872.7929
It does not necessarily follow that a deep,
intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours	273.0098
Bennet, who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the
affair as she wished, was excessively disappointed	3414.6575
Now and then, they were honoured with a call from her Ladyship,
and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during
these visits	1055.5476
Had Lydia's marriage been
concluded on the most honourable terms, it was not to be supposed that
Mr	2004.0217
"This is a parade," cried he, "which does one good; it gives such an
elegance to misfortune! Another day I will do the same; I will sit in
my library, in my night cap and powdering gown, and give as much trouble
as I can,--or, perhaps, I may defer it, till Kitty runs away	912.8133
--Lady Catherine was a tall, large woman, with
strongly-marked features, which might once have been handsome	2407.4224
"Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?" said Miss Bingley; "will
she be as tall as I am?"

"I think she will	226.4953
Such I was, from eight to eight and twenty; and such I might
still have been but for you, dearest, loveliest Elizabeth! What do I not
owe you! You taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most
advantageous	6076.4007
"

"You must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that your
refusal of my addresses is merely words of course	10074.0776
At such a distance as _that_, you know, things are strangely
misrepresented	277.6258
Bennet, "to walk
to Oakham Mount this morning	521.1721
The hill, crowned with wood, from
which they had descended, receiving increased abruptness from the
distance, was a beautiful object	720.1489
It adds even another motive	57.9624
He joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their
aunt's, where his regret and vexation, and the concern of every body was
well talked over	11849.1247

know	5052.1211

Collins's conversation to herself	33512.1614
"I told you the other day,
of his infamous behaviour to Mr	19724.6399
Reynolds, either
from pride or attachment, had evidently great pleasure in talking of her
master and his sister	2048.3434
When the ladies were separating for the toilette, he said to Elizabeth,

"Do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your apparel	474.9501
Bingley and Jane, however, soon allowed the others to
outstrip them	482.0059
I want to talk very seriously	13455.5529
Till I was in Kent, and saw
so much both of Mr	65931.1041
"

Away ran the girls, too eager to get in to have time for speech	7505.1069
"

She would not give him time to reply, but hurrying instantly to her
husband, called out as she entered the library,

"Oh! Mr	4008.1378

She had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of his
being partial to her, but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea; and Mrs	1110.5240
"

"We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that
evening," said Elizabeth	20700.0343
He had never before supposed
that, could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter, it would be
done with so little inconvenience to himself, as by the present
arrangement	38124.5473
This was his plan of amends--of atonement--for inheriting their father's
estate; and he thought it an excellent one, full of eligibility and
suitableness, and excessively generous and disinterested on his own
part	2000.2658
Darcy's
shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict, gave her a
keener sense of her sister's sufferings	465.8475
Gardiner	239372094.4113
"
Charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful, and
that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time	8742.2997
He was always to have gone on
Saturday, and to Saturday he still meant to stay	2855.5119
Forster to Meryton,
from whence they were to set out early the next morning	13086.6019
But it
was her business to be satisfied--and certainly her temper to be happy;
and all was soon right again	13153.2063
YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE	1.8706
"

"He likes to have his own way very well," replied Colonel Fitzwilliam	127897.2274
Elizabeth received her
congratulations amongst the rest, and then, sick of this folly, took
refuge in her own room, that she might think with freedom	1445.8202
The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every
female of the family	99709.7373
--Are you much acquainted with Mr	183161.9705
"

"Such as vanity and pride	4162.3247
Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my
positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand; for I
have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the
blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation	2438.7030
The families who had been in town for the winter came
back again, and summer finery and summer engagements arose	371.3385
It was an evening of no common delight to them all; the satisfaction of
Miss Bennet's mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face, as
made her look handsomer than ever	1585.5732
"

"Oh! it is of no consequence	673.6302
CHAPTER XII	13911.7883
_Your_
retrospections must be so totally void of reproach, that the contentment
arising from them, is not of philosophy, but what is much better, of
ignorance	3346.0813
Proud that in a cause of compassion and honour, he had been able to get
the better of himself	2089.7658
"Why, if he came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent," said she,
"did he come at all?"

She could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure	2461.0551
I shall walk to Meryton to-morrow to hear more
about it, and to ask when Mr	2726.3996
Oh! he is the handsomest young man that
ever was seen!"

Wickham, Lydia, were all forgotten	1.3303
If I may so express it, he has a _right_
to be proud	1984.6976
It
gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast; for she was in
no cheerful humour	1704.2999
Till this moment, I never knew myself	1196.0425
"Oh! Mary," said she, "I wish you had gone with us, for we had such fun!
as we went along, Kitty and me drew up all the blinds, and pretended
there was nobody in the coach; and I should have gone so all the way, if
Kitty had not been sick; and when we got to the George, I do think we
behaved very handsomely, for we treated the other three with the nicest
cold luncheon in the world, and if you would have gone, we would have
treated you too	3.2921
You know my sentiments	304.1201
Collins has yet
expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us, but I am very
certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for
it	4782.6475
Bennet was really in a most pitiable state	79373.5577
It was a painful, but
not an improbable, conjecture	931.9103
Collins wants to marry Lizzy?"

Nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne
without anger such treatment; but Sir William's good breeding carried
him through it all; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the
truth of his information, he listened to all their impertinence with the
most forbearing courtesy	218.3099
I do not wish to avoid the walk	12181.8573
--No one who has ever seen you
together, can doubt his affection	108694.6390
Collins's respectability, and
Charlotte's prudent, steady character	3397.7737
She wanted to ascertain the
feelings of each of her visitors, she wanted to compose her own, and to
make herself agreeable to all; and in the latter object, where she
feared most to fail, she was most sure of success, for those to whom she
endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour	9172.2043
She had
got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight,
and was certain of a willing listener in Jane, whenever she might wish
to talk again of either	8665.2258
Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1	120.1421
"

He listened to her with perfect indifference, while she chose to
entertain herself in this manner, and as his composure convinced her
that all was safe, her wit flowed long	8703.3608
"I have not the pleasure of understanding you," said he, when she had
finished her speech	108.6843
In
confirmation of this, she related the particulars of all the pecuniary
transactions in which they had been connected, without actually naming
her authority, but stating it to be such as might be relied on	2890.1982
Bennet give up the point	62229.3477
Lydia--the
humiliation, the misery, she was bringing on them all, soon swallowed up
every private care; and covering her face with her handkerchief,
Elizabeth was soon lost to every thing else; and, after a pause of
several minutes, was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the
voice of her companion, who, in a manner, which though it spoke
compassion, spoke likewise restraint, said, "I am afraid you have been
long desiring my absence, nor have I any thing to plead in excuse of my
stay, but real, though unavailing, concern	2531.5219
Lady Catherine was reckoned proud by many
people he knew, but _he_ had never seen any thing but affability in her	503.9975
"

"And this," cried Darcy, as he walked with quick steps across the room,
"is your opinion of me! This is the estimation in which you hold me! I
thank you for explaining it so fully	1416.2347
I congratulate her	99109.9153
Hurst, who had
married a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider
his house as her home when it suited her	15011.2365
Her enquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered	53935.2228
They were in ----

Lady Lucas began directly to calculate with more
interest than the matter had ever excited before, how many years longer

But enough of this	1202423.7497
But if I go on, I shall displease you by saying what
I think of persons you esteem	5582.0877
The vicious propensities--the
     want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge
     of his best friend, could not escape the observation of a young man
     of nearly the same age with himself, and who had opportunities of
     seeing him in unguarded moments, which Mr	2047.0185
Bennet could not give her consent, or
speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings,
though she talked to Bingley of nothing else, for half an hour; and when
Mr	5791.7084
org/files/42671/42671-h	1.0000
Mrs	33109675.6085
The respect created by the conviction of his
valuable qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some
time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings; and it was now heightened
into somewhat of a friendlier nature, by the testimony so highly in his
favour, and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light,
which yesterday had produced	4062.2284
CHAPTER XI	12216777.1972
The suspicions which had just
arisen of Mr	50723.2430
I am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just
said, and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long	674.3956
--Elizabeth took leave of
the whole party in the liveliest spirits	14363.6518
"How abominable!--I wonder that the very
pride of this Mr	36379.6596
From the entrance hall, of which Mr	66459.5104
Elizabeth, equally
next to Jane in birth and beauty, succeeded her of course	4361.8230
Darcy should hear the
first raptures of her joy, than the first vehemence of her
disapprobation	76997.3872
To Elizabeth it appeared, that had her family made an agreement to
expose themselves as much as they could during the evening, it would
have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit, or
finer success; and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister
that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice, and that his
feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he
must have witnessed	5680.9387
He was her dear Wickham on every
occasion; no one was to be put in competition with him	38762.1670
She was not sorry, however, to
have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from
whom they sprung	996.2412
Unfortunately an only son, (for many years an only _child_)
I was spoilt by my parents, who though good themselves, (my father
particularly, all that was benevolent and amiable,) allowed, encouraged,
almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing, to care for none beyond
my own family circle, to think meanly of all the rest of the world, to
_wish_ at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with
my own	2737.1023
But when you have had time to think it all over, I hope you
will be satisfied with what I have done	11337.7149
Of course, we hope that you will support the Project

When the gentlemen rose to go away, Mrs	5662.8911
Darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone for those
casual errors, under which she would endeavour to class, what Mr	1284.8817
"

Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to
continue the subject	2474.8381
"

"And of your infliction," cried Elizabeth with energy	13460.1329
"

Jane shook her head	59947.9226
If he is satisfied with only regretting me, when he might
have obtained my affections and hand, I shall soon cease to regret him
at all	5060.6702
We have judged it best, that my
     niece should be married from this house, of which I hope you will
     approve	14156.7756
"He is indeed--but considering the inducement, my dear Miss Eliza, we
cannot wonder at his complaisance; for who would object to such a
partner?"

Elizabeth looked archly, and turned away	6068.6661
I cannot
     understand it	3589.3694
Miss Lucas is married and settled	344.5829
Elizabeth, as she affectionately embraced her, whilst tears filled the
eyes of both, lost not a moment in asking whether any thing had been
heard of the fugitives	1350.6589
Bennet	686948320.9557
Follies
and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies _do_ divert me, I own, and I
laugh at them whenever I can	108.3882
"I hope," added Mrs	82.0984
She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear
of seeing Mr	1701.3088
"

"May I ask to what these questions tend?"

"Merely to the illustration of _your_ character," said she, endeavouring
to shake off her gravity	704.0555
--I will only say farther, that
     from what passed that evening, my opinion of all parties was
     confirmed, and every inducement heightened, which could have led me
     before, to preserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy
     connection	2025.2927
"

"And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike
to him, without any reason	1757.2010
Any other inconsistencies with modern spellings have
been left as printed	72.8919
"

To such perseverance in wilful self-deception Elizabeth would make no
reply, and immediately and in silence withdrew; determined, if he
persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering
encouragement, to apply to her father, whose negative might be uttered
in such a manner as must be decisive, and whose behaviour at least could
not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female	1467.9256
Is this to be endured! But it must not, shall not be	9590.5054
--"Oh! Mr	253.3697
Come as soon as you can on the receipt of
     this	5075.0999
"Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year?"

"Not so much as I could wish, Sir; but I dare say he may spend half his
time here; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months	1441.3959
I will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first
object	736.6511
Gardiner's business on her arrival, was to
distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions	117.9943
"And are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real
truth! Oh, that I knew how it was!"

But wishes were vain; or at best could serve only to amuse her in the
hurry and confusion of the following hour	810.3403
Bingley?"

"Not at all	7.9487
Darcy has no defect	10656.0805
"

"In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of	5167.2419
But we are none
of us consistent; and in his behaviour to me, there were stronger
impulses even than pride	1711.1907
--The younger ones out before the elder are married!--Your
younger sisters must be very young?"

"Yes, my youngest is not sixteen	2097.7976
Bingley," said her husband; "it is a person whom I
never saw in the whole course of my life	3817.1397
To be
sure that _did_ seem as if he admired her--indeed I rather believe he
_did_--I heard something about it--but I hardly know what--something
about Mr	4313.1287
She wished
to discredit it entirely, repeatedly exclaiming, "This must be false!
This cannot be! This must be the grossest falsehood!"--and when she had
gone through the whole letter, though scarcely knowing any thing of the
last page or two, put it hastily away, protesting that she would not
regard it, that she would never look in it again	1295.2956
Bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter,
and impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss the
opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible; advice, which there
was every reason to believe would be attended to; and in the clamorous
happiness of Lydia herself in bidding farewell, the more gentle adieus
of her sisters were uttered without being heard	1821.2334
"

"It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come since you will not
visit them	2671.6217
She was ashamed to think how
much	564.9807
Denny comes back from town	583.8165

"My motive for cautioning you, is as follows	11116.9100
It mortifies me	868.1162
Mr	112639004.1004
They were within twenty yards of each other, and so abrupt was his
appearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight	157.6509
In this quiet way, the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away	2874.8253
But they are very pleasing women when you
converse with them	61542.6406
"

"This is the consequence you see, Madam, of marrying a daughter," said
Elizabeth	60045.7850
You are
not well enough;--you cannot go yourself	61213.5449
I wish you had been there	216.4388
"

"Mr	1110951.7017
"Oh! my dear Lydia," she cried, "when shall we meet again?"

"Oh, lord! I don't know	3.2921
But at length, by Elizabeth's persuasion,
he was prevailed on to overlook the offence, and seek a reconciliation;
and, after a little farther resistance on the part of his aunt, her
resentment gave way, either to her affection for him, or her curiosity
to see how his wife conducted herself; and she condescended to wait on
them at Pemberley, in spite of that pollution which its woods had
received, not merely from the presence of such a mistress, but the
visits of her uncle and aunt from the city	2082.9823
His father, Miss Bennet, the late Mr	45535.2005
She talked on, therefore, without interruption from any of them till
they were joined by Mr	2946.7556
Forster, and the probability of her being yet more
imprudent with such a companion at Brighton, where the temptations must
be greater than at home	1287.9403
"

"You appear to me, Mr	45273.3482
"

Elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied, "Yes, you know enough of
my _frankness_ to believe me capable of _that_	22979.0586
He was most highly esteemed by Mr	13495.8753
"There is a gentleman with him, mamma," said Kitty; "who can it be?"

"Some acquaintance or other, my dear, I suppose; I am sure I do not
know	7135.3911
He added, that Mr	8220.9010
Mr	112639004.1004
"Oh! dear, yes;--but you must own she is very plain	3.2921
"

"Oh! no--it is not for _me_ to be driven away by Mr	673.6302
1	61834801.1648
It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life	2754.8214
Darcy, and Mr	1821.3318
It is a nice long walk, and Mr	1239.9583
Mrs	33109675.6085
Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade
in Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune and risen to the
honour of knighthood by an address to the King, during his mayoralty	3076.6791
"

"There is, I believe, in every disposition a tendency to some particular
evil, a natural defect, which not even the best education can overcome	4450.0680
"Good gracious! Lord bless me! only think! dear me! Mr	7.1767
Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below	110.4785
Bingley himself, Elizabeth withdrew
to Miss Lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last
partner she had scarcely replied, before Mr	5672.7336
She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet's height, or
rather taller	3900.1782
Let me take it
in the best light, in the light in which it may be understood	1429.1294
Mrs	33109675.6085
"

And when her sisters abused it as ugly, she added, with perfect
unconcern, "Oh! but there were two or three much uglier in the shop; and
when I have bought some prettier-coloured satin to trim it with fresh, I
think it will be very tolerable	2322.2190
His air was grave and
stately, and his manners were very formal	477.2818
Darcy himself; but,
whenever she did catch a glimpse, she saw an expression of general
complaisance, and in all that he said, she heard an accent so far
removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions, as convinced her that
the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed, however
temporary its existence might prove, had at least outlived one day	3156.2570
At least, therefore, I did not assume the character of needless
precipitance merely to shew off before the ladies	540.5178
"And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother?" said Mr	4099.6224
"

She burst into tears as she alluded to it, and for a few minutes could
not speak another word	433.4332
Her manners were
pronounced to be very bad indeed, a mixture of pride and impertinence;
she had no conversation, no style, no taste, no beauty	36266.0404
No sentiment of shame gave a damp to her
triumph	3805.0145
1	61834801.1648
"

"You may depend upon my not mentioning it	1012.7860
This event had at last been despaired of, but it was then too
late to be saving	3957.3459
Lady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeth's performance, mixing
with them many instructions on execution and taste	181.9045
"

"I _did_ hear, too, that there was a time, when sermon-making was not so
palatable to you as it seems to be at present; that you actually
declared your resolution of never taking orders, and that the business
had been compromised accordingly	2505.1833
I knew you would be wishing me joy	2306.0317
Our poor mother
     is sadly grieved	237.3209
--If, in the explanation of them which is
     due to myself, I am under the necessity of relating feelings which
     may be offensive to your's, I can only say that I am sorry	13775.7983
He was too happy, however, to need much attention;
and luckily for the others, the business of love-making relieved them
from a great deal of his company	2888.4068
I
     take up my pen again to do, what I have just told you I would not,
     but circumstances are such, that I cannot help earnestly begging
     you all to come here, as soon as possible	3022.3983
Hurst or Miss Bingley; and even Lydia was too
much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of "Lord,
how tired I am!" accompanied by a violent yawn	417.5566
and Mrs	37333.7087
No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you, can
think any thing wanting	11921.4892
"

He then recollected her embarrassment a few days before, on his reading
Mr	4602.2920
Bennet could hardly comprehend
it	200.1153
&c	1.0000
On the contrary every particular relative
to his sister, was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself; and
if I endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct, who
will believe me? The general prejudice against Mr	996.1673
--On this subject I have nothing more
     to say, no other apology to offer	1856.9083
Every thing, however, went on smoothly,
and was finally settled according to Charlotte's first sketch	5855.7793
"

He then shut the door, and coming up to her, claimed the good wishes and
affection of a sister	7613.9152

The sight of
Miss Lucas was odious to her	173810.6526
"

"Yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight	1930.8171
"

"But she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow	44275.2859
She was overpowered by shame and
vexation	1545.8941
Elizabeth, who had expected to find in her as
acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever Mr	646.6164
--Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the
easiness, openness, ductility of his temper, though no disposition could
offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he never
appeared dissatisfied	484.2074
Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother	573.9029
"

Mrs	47234646.3654
At such a moment, the arrival of her friend
was a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth, though in the course of their
meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought, when she
saw Mr	1850.3326
Gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing, he asked
her, if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends	1774.0153
The latter was much more
agreeable than his companion expected	7213.6430
Multiple
      superscripted characters are enclosed by curly brackets
      (example: M^{rs})	5.4565
The darling wish of his
sisters was then gratified; he bought an estate in a neighbouring county
to Derbyshire, and Jane and Elizabeth, in addition to every other source
of happiness, were within thirty miles of each other	2117.9971
Had not my own feelings decided
against you, had they been indifferent, or had they even been
favourable, do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept
the man, who has been the means of ruining, perhaps for ever, the
happiness of a most beloved sister?"

As she pronounced these words, Mr	856.2695
Bennet withdrew to the library, she saw
Mr	6097.5029
"

"You are over scrupulous surely	630.0004
Darcy is neither by
honour nor inclination confined to his cousin, why is not he to make
another choice? And if I am that choice, why may not I accept him?"

"Because honour, decorum, prudence, nay, interest, forbid it	255.5937
She
must own that she was tired of great houses; after going over so many,
she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains	529.5477

next day, and their aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr	3011.3501

Absence had increased her desire of seeing
Charlotte again, and weakened her disgust of Mr	269.7443
But he had given a reason for his interference, which asked no
extraordinary stretch of belief	4715.7156
"Your affectionate friend,

     "LYDIA BENNET	2122.0392
"

"I have already told her so once, by your desire	10824.0363
"




CHAPTER XVIII	20961378.5120
Darcy had to decide on the propriety of
his friend's inclination, or why, upon his own judgment alone, he was to
determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy	12670.4529
--One does not know what to
think	350.9291
Bennet, offended by his manner of mentioning a
country neighbourhood	9418.4300
Forgive
me; and if you persist in indifference, do not make _me_ your
confidante	132.6150
"

"Are they indeed?" cried Elizabeth, with the greatest satisfaction	3460.8565
There is nothing else to be done	6373.3776
He leaves out half his words, and blots the rest	338.1093
She
could not bear such suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper,
wrote a short letter to her aunt, to request an explanation of what
Lydia had dropt, if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been
intended	1251.2246
I have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment	128.1683
--His
     sisters' uneasiness had been equally excited with my own; our
     coincidence of feeling was soon discovered; and, alike sensible
     that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother, we shortly
     resolved on joining him directly in London	2146.0160
Mrs	33109675.6085
Collins's scruples of leaving Mr	284.0115
--I
think it no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements	483.3051
The marriage of a daughter, which had been the first object of
her wishes, since Jane was sixteen, was now on the point of
accomplishment, and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those
attendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new carriages, and
servants	5358.6058
Mrs	33109675.6085
In the dining-room they were soon joined by Mary and Kitty, who had been
too busily engaged in their separate apartments, to make their
appearance before	934.9539
Oh, brother,
how kind you are! I know you will contrive it all	3918.2674
You need not	237581.8606
But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness, is a most
natural consequence of the prejudices I had been encouraging	3628.6562
I am not indebted for my present happiness to
your eager desire of expressing your gratitude	8992.0042
Darcy might have done as well	2875.2481
"

Elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those
in the room	1047.6763
--Elizabeth could but just _affect_ concern in
missing him; she really rejoiced at it	1938.2056
It would look odd to be
entirely silent for half an hour together, and yet for the advantage of
_some_, conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the
trouble of saying as little as possible	584.3071
"

Elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character, but said
nothing	6738.4753
Wickham was as far beyond them all in person, countenance, air, and
walk, as _they_ were superior to the broad-faced stuffy uncle Philips,
breathing port wine, who followed them into the room	3894.7475
Bingley before, expressed to her sister how very much
she admired him	9652.5467
On distinguishing the ladies of the group,
the two gentlemen came directly towards them, and began the usual
civilities	2942.6397
intending to trace their route	415.6354
"FITZWILLIAM DARCY	1416.0382
Their taking her home, and affording her their personal
protection and countenance, is such a sacrifice to her advantage, as
years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge	4259.4125
--They had several children	25326.9610
I was very
uncomfortable, I may say unhappy	208.4322
Gardiner left them soon after breakfast	106224.0532
"

Mr	62968.0509
How much you
must have gone through!"

Her sister, however, assured her, of her being perfectly well; and their
conversation, which had been passing while Mr	4046.6608
Darcy appeared again, when,
looking at him, she was a little relieved by his smile	1732.0970
The whole family in short
were properly overjoyed on the occasion	3434.0948
They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to
have their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little as
possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your
life	2695.5371
Mrs	33109675.6085
She is on her road somewhere, I dare say, and so passing through
Meryton, thought she might as well call on you	19774.2052
"

"I have not a doubt of Mr	4323.0075
Collins has made
you an offer of marriage	259.9411
He then sat down by her, and talked scarcely to any one else	1574.5875
She was engaged one day as she walked, in re-perusing Jane's last
letter, and dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane had not
written in spirits, when, instead of being again surprised by Mr	4188.7904
Collins well	22167.7019
Bennet's sour looks and ill-natured remarks might have been
enough to drive happiness away	877.9013
You must and shall be married by a special licence	118501.3094
No motive can
excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted _there_	13.3741
"

"Yes, vanity is a weakness indeed	26986.4005
"

"It is evident by this," added Jane, "that he comes back no more this
winter	624.7572
Mr	112639004.1004
Lord!
how I should like to be married before any of you; and then I would
chaperon you about to all the balls	2.2924
But she had no reason to fear Mr	98.6423
It cannot last long	130.1775
"Now," said she, "that this first meeting is over, I feel perfectly
easy	279.6134
You know not what you are
about	698.0975
I am afraid you will not be able to make
     it out, but I hardly know what I have written	406.1239
The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work	1773.8099
You shewed me how insufficient were all my
pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased	6933.0800
But who was your mother? Who
are your uncles and aunts? Do not imagine me ignorant of their
condition	10304.1872
Bennet's visit, and sat about ten
minutes with him in his library	613.6841
"

He should be particularly happy at any time, &c	2687.0025
"I admire all my three sons-in-law highly," said he	620.5300
They
ran through the vestibule into the breakfast room; from thence to the
library;--their father was in neither; and they were on the point of
seeking him up stairs with their mother, when they were met by the
butler, who said,

"If you are looking for my master, ma'am, he is walking towards the
little copse	3551.9996
It was an
encouragement of vice; and had I been the rector of Longbourn, I should
very strenuously have opposed it	1210.8217
Wickham, we are brother and sister, you know	1414.6158
"

"I know you do; and it is _that_ which makes the wonder	1228.9433
Miss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any
extenuating circumstances in the case, unknown to the society of
Hertfordshire; her mild and steady candour always pleaded for
allowances, and urged the possibility of mistakes--but by everybody else
Mr	1096.5071
Kitty, run down and order the carriage	4379.0405
Collins; and whatever might be his feelings towards her
friend, met her with every appearance of composure	93122.3934
Bennet half opened the door and called out,

"Lizzy, my dear, I want to speak with you	1766.2579
The
wish of procuring her regard, which she had assured herself of his
feeling in Derbyshire, could not in rational expectation survive such a
blow as this	1497.5972
" She then sought her eldest sister, who had undertaken to make
inquiries on the same subject of Bingley	1464.3875
Gardiner, though seldom able to indulge the
taste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much engaged in watching the
occasional appearance of some trout in the water, and talking to the man
about them, that he advanced but little	3415.0016

Foundation's web site and official page at www	99.4208
Wickham	242955402.4908
At such an assembly as this, it
would be insupportable	430.6676
Bingley
was obliged to be in town the following day, and consequently unable to
accept the honour of their invitation, &c	8035.6856
Darcy	755710066.5731
Not a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till their
visitor took his leave for the night; but as soon as he was gone, he
turned to his daughter and said,

"Jane, I congratulate you	2359.8517
He
must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found
her	2082.6325
So near
a vicinity to her mother and Meryton relations was not desirable even to
_his_ easy temper, or _her_ affectionate heart	823.7315
I believe him to be Lady Catherine's _nephew_	2928.3752
Neither had any thing occurred in the intelligence of
their Lambton friends, that could materially lessen its weight	1250.0670
Elizabeth felt Jane's
pleasure	266.5438
Collins should be in possession of the
Longbourn estate, it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife
should make their appearance at St	1149.0663
CHAPTER III	13911.7883
But
my dearest love, tell me what dish Mr	1846.0621
"What can be the meaning of this!" said Charlotte, as soon as he was
gone	265.5922
She dreaded seeing Wickham again,
and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible	25191.3658
They had often attempted it before, but it was a subject on which Mrs	378.6142
Darcy replied with great intrepidity,

"Miss Elizabeth Bennet	12909.4162
They have
known her much longer than they have known me; no wonder if they love
her better	5617.5110
Colonel Forster came yesterday, having left Brighton the day
     before, not many hours after the express	26578.4753
"

They were all astonished; and Mr	5891.3737
Hurst and Miss Bingley, they were noticed only by a curtsey; and
on their being seated, a pause, awkward as such pauses must always be,
succeeded for a few moments	1070.6723
We _will_ know where
we have gone--we _will_ recollect what we have seen	1129.0600
He only meant that there were not
such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town, which
you must acknowledge to be true	2371.8986
"

"You persist, then, in supposing his sisters influence him	17591.4852
I thought I should have died	1270.9440
--Mr	84188683.0881
Mrs	33109675.6085
In every thing else she is as
good natured a girl as ever lived	24385.2885
"

Miss Bennet still looked all amazement	3394.3237
Will you be very angry with me, my dear
     Lizzy, if I take this opportunity of saying (what I was never bold
     enough to say before) how much I like him	5865.9213
Mrs	33109675.6085
"

"We are speaking of music, Madam," said he, when no longer able to avoid
a reply	3147.7128
Bennet could certainly
spare you for another fortnight	3999.3882
Mr	112639004.1004
"

"Pride," observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of her
reflections, "is a very common failing I believe	2142.1511
--Here you are in your own family	130000.3597
Wickham	242955402.4908
It could not be for society, as he frequently sat there
ten minutes together without opening his lips; and when he did speak, it
seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice--a sacrifice to
propriety, not a pleasure to himself	2260.5070
Mrs	33109675.6085
"

Elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal; yet
was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an
epithet	1743.8604
Her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined	2942.0411
He
then said,

"I have received a letter this morning that has astonished me
exceedingly	1615.2773
"

"To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of
either	8999.4388
"Well, Lizzy," continued her mother soon afterwards, "and so the
Collinses live very comfortable, do they? Well, well, I only hope it
will last	5478.4058
Collins too!--Why should _he_ have it more than anybody else?"

"I leave it to yourself to determine," said Mr	8774.7799
Bingley did
not do justice to his own disposition	401.5011
They will then join his regiment,
     unless they are first invited to Longbourn; and I understand from
     Mrs	3201.6377
Hurst, "in running away
without telling us that you were coming out	4516.8876
Nothing, on the contrary, could be more natural; and while able to
suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her, she was
ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both, and could very
sincerely wish him happy	1121.7338
Darcy
returned within the stated time	4979.1409
They had frequently been staying with her in town	3777.9128
--Without thinking highly
either of men or of matrimony, marriage had always been her object; it
was the only honourable provision for well-educated young women of small
fortune, and however uncertain of giving happiness, must be their
pleasantest preservative from want	899.4885
--The
     necessity must be obeyed--and farther apology would be absurd	416.3152
It had better have happened to _you_, Lizzy; you
would have laughed yourself out of it sooner	16144.4032
I am not ashamed of having been
mistaken--or, at least, it is slight, it is nothing in comparison of
what I should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters	4592.9795
To Kitty, however, it does not
     seem so wholly unexpected	4409.7775
Darcy only can answer	226918.8217
They are not married,
     nor can I find there was any intention of being so; but if you are
     willing to perform the engagements which I have ventured to make on
     your side, I hope it will not be long before they are	12178.2901
He may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my
acquaintance, but that is all	4797.5288
With amazement did
she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power;
and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to
give, which a just sense of shame would not conceal	3107.6019
You must
give me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the compliment of
believing what I say	2030.1442
But little had she dared
to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there	10655.0279
For a few moments, indeed,
she felt that he would probably strike into some other path	3926.5518
"You certainly do," she replied with a smile; "but it does not follow
that the interruption must be unwelcome	521.4609
At our time of life, it is not so
pleasant I can tell you, to be making new acquaintance every day; but
for your sakes, we would do any thing	4654.7735
Wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled, a
doubt of his being present had never occurred to her	1373.0160
Had they fixed on any other man
it would have been nothing; but _his_ perfect indifference, and _your_
pointed dislike, make it so delightfully absurd! Much as I abominate
writing, I would not give up Mr	715.9002
They
entered it in one of its lowest points, and drove for some time through
a beautiful wood, stretching over a wide extent	205.8495
Sometimes she could fancy, that he talked less than on
former occasions, and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that
as he looked at her, he was trying to trace a resemblance	1037.7655
They insist also on
     my seeing Mr	1424.9152
"When is your next ball to be, Lizzy?"

"To-morrow fortnight	3927.7468

In vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable, and Jane to make
her resigned	14254.0039
Girls, can I do any
thing for you in Meryton? Oh! here comes Hill	131345.7866
"I will go to Meryton," said she, "as soon as I am dressed, and tell the
good, good news to my sister Philips	5344.9675
Collins's picture of Hunsford and
Rosings rationally softened; and Elizabeth perceived that she must wait
for her own visit there, to know the rest	7057.2606
"

Elizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at Mr	798.1465
I now give it to _you_, if you are resolved on
having him	34489.8119
"

"It is no such thing	119076.5115
She talked to Elizabeth again and again;
coaxed and threatened her by turns	1730.9420
Her favourite walk, and where
she frequently went while the others were calling on Lady Catherine, was
along the open grove which edged that side of the park, where there was
a nice sheltered path, which no one seemed to value but herself, and
where she felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherine's curiosity	1977.7313
The business of her life was to get her
daughters married; its solace was visiting and news	3225.5852
That had
his actions been what Wickham represented them, so gross a violation of
every thing right could hardly have been concealed from the world; and
that friendship between a person capable of it, and such an amiable man
as Mr	977.9517
This is the last time I shall ever
remember it myself	20391.5583
He could even
listen to Sir William Lucas, when he complimented him on carrying away
the brightest jewel of the country, and expressed his hopes of their all
meeting frequently at St	1039.1207
Darcy chose to doubt it--or to treat it as a merely
conditional recommendation, and to assert that I had forfeited all claim
to it by extravagance, imprudence, in short any thing or nothing	3365.0137
--Not that I have much pleasure indeed in
talking to any body	1511.4288
"It
seems likely to have been a desirable match for Jane," said she	2053.2663
Her coming there was the most unfortunate, the most ill-judged
thing in the world! How strange must it appear to him! In what a
disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man! It might seem as if
she had purposely thrown herself in his way again! Oh! why did she come?
or, why did he thus come a day before he was expected? Had they been
only ten minutes sooner, they should have been beyond the reach of his
discrimination, for it was plain that he was that moment arrived, that
moment alighted from his horse or his carriage	6093.6433

It is very unlucky; but as I have actually paid the visit, we

"About a month ago I received this letter, and about a fortnight ago I
answered it, for I thought it a case of some delicacy, and requiring
early attention	558.8118
Collins was at leisure to look around him and admire, and he was so much
struck with the size and furniture of the apartment, that he declared he
might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour
at Rosings; a comparison that did not at first convey much
gratification; but when Mrs	5216.5241

unhappy	5491.1500
What he told me was merely this; that he congratulated himself
on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most
imprudent marriage, but without mentioning names or any other
particulars, and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing him
the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort, and from
knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer	3767.4684

Miss Bingley's congratulations to her brother, on his approaching
marriage, were all that was affectionate and insincere	5669.9539

make her visitors forget their inferior rank	4024.4128
Gardiner; and after relating the
circumstances, she thus went on:--"I am now convinced, my dear aunt,
that I have never been much in love; for had I really experienced that

"You must not be too severe upon yourself," replied Elizabeth	2122.1002
Gardiner	239372094.4113
Collins,

With the Gardiners, they were always on the most intimate terms	31421.7262
She turned from sister to sister, demanding their
congratulations, and when at length they all sat down, looked eagerly
round the room, took notice of some little alteration in it, and
observed, with a laugh, that it was a great while since she had been
there	1458.6702

"Miss Elizabeth Bennet!" repeated Miss Bingley	40707.6408
This preservative she had now
obtained; and at the age of twenty-seven, without having ever been
handsome, she felt all the good luck of it	3328.1390
--Elizabeth accepted their company, and the three young ladies set
off together	1140.6653
He
found her as handsome as she had been last year; as good natured, and as
unaffected, though not quite so chatty	10754.4933
In revolving lady Catherine's expressions, however, she could not help
feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting
in this interference	708.5695
Philips
protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery
tickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards	1049.9471
"There has
been many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way	28329.7331

     my youth, the acknowledged favourite of my father, a young man who
     had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage, and who
     had been brought up to expect its exertion, would be a depravity,
     to which the separation of two young persons, whose affection could
     be the growth of only a few weeks, could bear no comparison	1951.6809
If you

Between Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept them
mutually silent on the subject; and Elizabeth felt persuaded that no
real confidence could ever subsist between them again	954.7036

only headstrong in such matters as these	1659.1147

Elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference for

information of so satisfactory a nature, as the compliment deserved	706.4140

     say, there will be some little money, even when all his debts are
     discharged, to settle on my niece, in addition to her own fortune	11945.0705
Bennet could not have chosen
better	2075.7579
"

"And if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he has at least
great pleasure in the power of choice	17303.5212
Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of
Mr	2423.2490
Well, he certainly is
very agreeable, and I give you leave to like him	76876.7438
"And they are really to be married!" cried Elizabeth, as soon as they
were by themselves	3579.4196
They went to the library,
therefore, and asked their father, whether he would not wish them to
make it known to her	2780.4361
"

"Go, my dear," cried her mother, "and shew her ladyship about the
different walks	393.0932
She has been doing
every thing in her power by thinking and talking on the subject, to give
greater--what shall I call it? susceptibility to her feelings; which are
naturally lively enough	748.8203

Seriously, I would have you be on your guard	222804.7704
Here are officers enough at
Meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country	117.7987
But
this idea was soon banished, and her spirits were very differently
affected, when, to her utter amazement, she saw Mr	11560.3967
Not one party, or scheme, or any thing	70630.7750
"

"But does Lydia know nothing of this? Can she be ignorant of what you
and Jane seem so well to understand?"

"Oh, yes!--that, that is the worst of all	3601.1298
That she should receive an offer of
marriage from Mr	1594.0140
--The last born has as good a right to the pleasures of
youth, as the first	674.5097
My reproofs at Hunsford could not
work such a change as this	27660.6388
After breakfast, the girls walked to Meryton to inquire if Mr	6542.6042
"He is just what a young man ought to be," said she, "sensible, good
humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners!--so much ease,
with such perfect good breeding!"

"He is also handsome," replied Elizabeth, "which a young man ought
likewise to be, if he possibly can	1848.4581
I was not in a humour to
wait for any opening of your's	40714.1738
"--And
upon Elizabeth's seeming really, with vexed and embarrassed looks, about
to escape, she added, "Lizzy, I _insist_ upon your staying and hearing
Mr	725.8001

another very welcome surprise; for his chief wish at present, was to
have as little trouble in the business as possible	22942.2180

so cordial	230.4095

His behaviour to her sister was such, during dinner time, as shewed an
admiration of her, which, though more guarded than formerly, persuaded
Elizabeth, that if left wholly to himself, Jane's happiness, and his
own, would be speedily secured	761.8609
Bennet sat looking and winking at
Elizabeth and Catherine for a considerable time, without making any
impression on them	19200.1615
Bennet, in short, was in very great spirits; she had seen enough of
Bingley's behaviour to Jane, to be convinced that she would get him at
last; and her expectations of advantage to her family, when in a happy
humour, were so far beyond reason, that she was quite disappointed at
not seeing him there again the next day, to make his proposals	3794.2288
and Mrs	37333.7087
They were off Saturday night about twelve, as
     is conjectured, but were not missed till yesterday morning at
     eight	4685.2941

conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them,
without actual blame on either side	4057.2559

acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself	4644.7929
There was too much to
be thought; and felt, and said, for attention to any other objects	4698.1778
Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of
passing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and was too
much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas
was his neighbour, till Sir William thus began	11266.0694
"I have been thinking it over again, Elizabeth," said her uncle, as they
drove from the town; "and really, upon serious consideration, I am much
more inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does of the
matter	2240.9128

saying something that might turn her mother's thoughts, now asked her if
Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since _her_ coming away	1425.5517
The Lucases are very artful people indeed,

Bingley, and the
train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to,
made her perhaps almost as happy as Jane	571.1540

Gardiner, "there is no absolute proof
that they are not gone to Scotland	136.4056

are provoking me to it every moment	1406.8914

"Well, then, you need not be under any alarm	3662.0719

fortune	3822.3495

journey, and brought its master back to Longbourn	4710.5920
In the first place, she persisted in disbelieving
the whole of the matter; secondly, she was very sure that Mr	517.9178
She does not yet leave her dressing-room	337096.8208
He was growing quite
inattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by her	6603.7571
And yet, upon my honour, I
believed what I said of myself to be true, and I believe it at this
moment	17826.6621
Collins
received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure, and then
proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview, with the result
of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied, since the
refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow
from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character	4869.3818
The feelings
of the person who wrote, and the person who received it, are now so
widely different from what they were then, that every unpleasant
circumstance attending it, ought to be forgotten	8795.4696
Not these two or three years perhaps	7237.9110
Now be sincere;
did you admire me for my impertinence?"

"For the liveliness of your mind, I did	1494.1032
She could neither
wonder nor condemn, but the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing
consolatory to her bosom, afforded no palliation of her distress	589.3899
Miss Bingley's civility to Elizabeth increased at last
very rapidly, as well as her affection for Jane; and when they parted,
after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to
see her either at Longbourn or Netherfield, and embracing her most
tenderly, she even shook hands with the former	2408.0812
When convinced on that article, Miss Bennet had nothing
farther to wish	3975.6481
His character was decided	9680.5441
The park was very large, and contained great variety of ground	28591.5536
are
sufficiently known	92.2781
She accounted for it, however, by supposing that
her last letter to her friend from Longbourn, had by some accident been
lost	9345.1378
"

"Your list of the common extent of accomplishments," said Darcy, "has
too much truth	2433.2185
A small sum could not do all this	494.0971
Hope was over, entirely over; and when Jane could attend to the rest of
the letter, she found little, except the professed affection of the
writer, that could give her any comfort	391.5390
But I believe your opinion of him would in general
astonish--and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly
anywhere else	1226.6979
Bingley was the principal spokesman, and Miss Bennet the
principal object	19118.7182
And their
mother had the satisfaction of knowing, that she should be able to shew
her married daughter in the neighbourhood, before she was banished to
the North	6611.0456
I shall never be quite happy till I
     have been all round the park	28280.9744
"

"You did! and it was not wholly without foundation	5795.4009
But Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every prospect
of her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not dwell long on her
spirits; and having told all her griefs to Charlotte Lucas, whom she had
not seen for a week, she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to
the oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her particular
notice	1228.1232
Bingley called again, and alone	1393.4059
Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners were very much admired at the parsonage,
and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of
their engagements at Rosings	7970.5565
Lakes, mountains,
and rivers, shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations; nor, when
we attempt to describe any particular scene, will we begin quarrelling
about its relative situation	272.9739
You have delighted us long enough	4844.5283
"

He then told her of Georgiana's delight in her acquaintance, and of her
disappointment at its sudden interruption; which naturally leading to
the cause of that interruption, she soon learnt that his resolution of
following her from Derbyshire in quest of her sister, had been formed
before he quitted the inn, and that his gravity and thoughtfulness
there, had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must
comprehend	3633.9081
I was uncomfortable enough	8040.2943
She asked her at different times, how many sisters
she had, whether they were older or younger than herself, whether any of
them were likely to be married, whether they were handsome, where they
had been educated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been her
mother's maiden name?--Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her
questions, but answered them very composedly	9871.3107
"Of music! Then pray speak aloud	250.8876
But it ought to
be done, and if you will give me a sheet of paper, it shall be done
directly	6070.2999

"That is very true," replied Elizabeth, "and I could easily forgive
_his_ pride, if he had not mortified _mine_	171.7913
Egerton,
Military Library, Whitehall	12.6655
There--I have saved you the trouble of accounting for it;
and really, all things considered, I begin to think it perfectly
reasonable	8900.1354
They crossed it by a simple bridge, in character with the general air of
the scene; it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited; and
the valley, here contracted into a glen, allowed room only for the
stream, and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered
it	568.2789
I hope I never ridicule what is wise or good	1614.7654
"

Elizabeth's spirits were so high on the occasion, that though she did
not often speak unnecessarily to Mr	708.8494
Gardiner could do	199924.5813
Darcy took up a book; Miss Bingley did the same;
and Mrs	68964.1683
It amazes
me, I confess;--for certainly, there can be nothing so advantageous to
them as instruction	1010.9621
Amongst the most violent against him was Mrs	438.2849
Collins to join his daughters in their
walk; and Mr	26555.5295
To Jane, he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused, and
whose merit she had undervalued; but to her own more extensive
information, he was the person, to whom the whole family were indebted
for the first of benefits, and whom she regarded herself with an
interest, if not quite so tender, at least as reasonable and just, as
what Jane felt for Bingley	3771.1228
Darcy
had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance	3925.3778
--But I tell you what, Miss Lizzy, if you take
it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way,
you will never get a husband at all--and I am sure I do not know who is
to maintain you when your father is dead	1186.7499
Her affections had been continually
fluctuating, but never without an object	5906.9591

Elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some music books
that lay on the instrument, how frequently Mr	275.8585

nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither
lay; Oxford, Blenheim, Warwick, Kenelworth, Birmingham, &c	224.9558
But the gloom of Lydia's prospect was shortly cleared away; for she
received an invitation from Mrs	6267.8631
Darcy corroborated it with a bow, and
was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on Elizabeth, when they
were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger, and Elizabeth
happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other,
was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting	1813.7624
--But their
father, though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure, was really
glad to see them; he had felt their importance in the family circle	7299.9474
Darcy rise also and follow him, and her agitation on seeing it was
extreme	712.8755
The
liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value!"

She was now, on being settled at home, at leisure to observe the real
state of her sister's spirits	1244.5312
It was, moreover, such a promising thing for her younger
daughters, as Jane's marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of
other rich men; and lastly, it was so pleasant at her time of life to be
able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister, that
she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked	2318.9156

As to
his real character, had information been in her power, she had never
felt a wish of enquiring	5286.9290
Every day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety; but the most anxious
part of each was when the post was expected	49845.6846
The old lady is Mrs	925.2244
"

"We will be down as soon as we can," said Jane; "but I dare say Kitty is
forwarder than either of us, for she went up stairs half an hour ago	7235.2211
I wish I could see her	2302.7131
She had not at first thought very seriously of
going thither; but Charlotte, she soon found, was depending on the plan,
and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure
as well as greater certainty	6966.8442
She felt anew the justice of Mr	2301.8053
"It must not be thought of	7495.4586
"

"Is my father in town?"

"Yes, he went on Tuesday as I wrote you word	7575.8192
Darcy's character, though he had assured her that respect for the
father, would always prevent his exposing the son	64059.9971
Mr	112639004.1004
They agreed that Mrs	186791.8376
Collins listened to her
with the determined air of following his own inclination, and when she
ceased speaking, replied thus,

"My dear Miss Elizabeth, I have the highest opinion in the world of your
excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your
understanding, but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference
between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity, and those
which regulate the clergy; for give me leave to observe that I consider
the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank
in the kingdom--provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the
same time maintained	1658.2475
"

Mr	62968.0509
I shall offer to pay him to-morrow; he will rant and storm about
his love for you, and there will be an end of the matter	7245.2548
She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings,
and had sent for him only the Saturday before, to make up her pool of
quadrille in the evening	1666.5560
At night she opened her heart to Jane	4440.4005
"

"Neither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude," replied Elizabeth, "have any
possible claim on me, in the present instance	4873.3154
"I have an excessive regard for Jane Bennet, she is really a very sweet
girl, and I wish with all my heart she were well settled	591.3898

hope he will overlook it	108.5175
Good Heaven! Brighton, and a whole
campful of soldiers, to us, who have been overset already by one poor
regiment of militia, and the monthly balls of Meryton	201.9437
They
had nothing to accuse him of but pride; pride he probably had, and if
not, it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small
market-town, where the family did not visit	5562.2255

Does she live near you, sir?"

"The garden in which stands my humble abode, is separated only by a lane
from Rosings Park, her ladyship's residence	74.9292
'Lady
Catherine,' said she, 'you have given me a treasure	3235.5924
As soon as they were gone, Elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits;
or in other words, to dwell without interruption on those subjects that
must deaden them more	1297.2844
Such were the gentle murmurs of Mrs	208.6398
Mrs	33109675.6085
It is very often nothing but
our own vanity that deceives us	550.7032
James's, Sir William was so completely
awed, by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had but just courage
enough to make a very low bow, and take his seat without saying a word;
and his daughter, frightened almost out of her senses, sat on the edge
of her chair, not knowing which way to look	1359.6603
"

"How can you contrive to write so even?"

He was silent	2322.8958
However, your coming just at this time is the
greatest of comforts, and I am very glad to hear what you tell us, of
long sleeves	1889.0398
She began at length to recover, to
fidget about in her chair, get up, sit down again, wonder, and bless
herself	2242.2213
"

"_That_ is a failing indeed!"--cried Elizabeth	7801.7432
Their society can afford no pleasure,
that will atone for such wretchedness as this! Let me never see either
one or the other again!"

Yet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer no
compensation, received soon afterwards material relief, from observing
how much the beauty of her sister re-kindled the admiration of her
former lover	2578.1059

She was quite amazed
at her own discomposure; but amongst other causes of disquiet, she
dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in
her favour; and more than commonly anxious to please, she naturally
suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her	9360.6799
"

"If you mean Darcy," cried her brother, "he may go to bed, if he chuses,
before it begins--but as for the ball, it is quite a settled thing; and
as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough I shall send round my
cards	4534.4254
"

Elizabeth looked at Darcy to see how cordially he assented to his
cousin's praise; but neither at that moment nor at any other could she
discern any symptom of love; and from the whole of his behaviour to Miss
De Bourgh she derived this comfort for Miss Bingley, that he might have
been just as likely to marry _her_, had she been his relation	2376.4404
I promised
them so faithfully! What will Wickham say? It was to be such a secret!"

"If it was to be secret," said Jane, "say not another word on the
subject	415.0804
But let me advise you to think better of it	21974.5697
Darcy was really the
object of her choice, by explaining the gradual change which her
estimation of him had undergone, relating her absolute certainty that
his affection was not the work of a day, but had stood the test of many
months suspense, and enumerating with energy all his good qualities, she
did conquer her father's incredulity, and reconcile him to the match	2672.2906
"

"Oh! where, where is my uncle?" cried Elizabeth, darting from her seat
as she finished the letter, in eagerness to follow him, without losing a
moment of the time so precious; but as she reached the door, it was
opened by a servant, and Mr	673.6302
E	1.0000
"Yes, she called yesterday with her father	1201.7411
She felt it so; and though, in
looking forward, neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity,
could be justly expected for her sister; in looking back to what they
had feared, only two hours ago, she felt all the advantages of what they
had gained	1102.3013
"

Mr	62968.0509
"

Elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt persuaded
of her sister's ready acquiescence	2962.7110
She cared for none
     of her friends, she wanted no help of his, she would not hear of
     leaving Wickham	3098.6343
"

"Kitty has no discretion in her coughs," said her father; "she times
them ill	3301.0473
Bennet's eyes sparkled with pleasure, and she was
eagerly calling out, while her daughter read,

"Well, Jane, who is it from? what is it about? what does he say? Well,
Jane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love	2420.8188
Mrs	33109675.6085

established as a sweet girl, and their brother felt authorised by such

He had been some days in town, before he was able to
     discover them; but he had something to direct his search, which was
     more than _we_ had; and the consciousness of this, was another
     reason for his resolving to follow us	1928.7345

mile behind	96100.9779

other table	1514.8110

mother, was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of
an ensign	3037.0028
"

"Upon my word, Sir," cried Elizabeth, "your hope is rather an
extraordinary one after my declaration	104.4222
The
happiness which this reply produced, was such as he had probably never
felt before; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as
warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do	5031.4594
Darcy, only for a few minutes to take
leave, but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least
an hour, hoping for her return, and almost resolving to walk after her
till she could be found	9358.5139
"

It was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now	732.6177
You have sense, and we all
expect you to use it	2429.6980
Let us hope, therefore, that her being
there may teach her her own insignificance	9027.6393
Bingley and Jane were standing together, a little detached from the
rest, and talked only to each other	26370.9719
Wickham was to
     the last so steady, that in his will he particularly recommended it
     to me, to promote his advancement in the best manner that his
     profession might allow, and if he took orders, desired that a
     valuable family living might be his as soon as soon as it became
     vacant	6367.9773
The supposition did not pain her	8349.9848
Darcy with grave propriety requested to be allowed the honour of her
hand; but in vain	3528.6479
Darcy's letter, nor explain to her sister how sincerely she
had been valued by his friend	1184.2709
"

"Is this a hint to me, Lizzy," said her father, "to send for the
horses?"

"No, indeed	3238.5394
My aunt told me so
herself on Saturday	163616.9833
They were confined for the evening at different tables, and she had
nothing to hope, but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side
of the room, as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself	2371.5054

back	3319.6694

want of attention to other people's feelings, and want of resolution,

     indifferent because I wished it;--I believed it on impartial
     conviction, as truly as I wished it in reason	27181.0207

else, awakened a suspicion of the truth	1867.3722

"Good gracious!" cried Mrs	34.1789
"

"Oh!--Your uncle!--He keeps a man-servant, does he?--I am very glad you
have somebody who thinks of those things	1262.3722
Will you come and see me?"

"We shall often meet, I hope, in Hertfordshire	34360.6140
"

"I beg your pardon," replied Miss Bingley, turning away with a sneer	3691.6058
Mr	112639004.1004
Miss Darcy looked as if she
wished for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes did venture a
short sentence, when there was least danger of its being heard	14929.0845
"

Mrs	47234646.3654
Mrs	33109675.6085
While the contents of the first
letter remained on her mind, she was all surprise--all astonishment that
Wickham should marry a girl, whom it was impossible he could marry for
money; and how Lydia could ever have attached him, had appeared
incomprehensible	2066.7659
A military life is not what I was intended for, but circumstances have
now made it eligible	97499.2889
Is not it so, Mrs	1607994.4386
His behaviour to us has,
     in every respect, been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire	6012.8871
Bingley and his sisters came to give their
personal invitation for the long expected ball at Netherfield, which was
fixed for the following Tuesday	6085.6630
When I last saw her, she was not very promising	1681.5718
Having now a good house and very sufficient income, he intended to
marry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn family he had
a wife in view, as he meant to chuse one of the daughters, if he found
them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report	2624.6652
Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject; and
affectionately taking her hand, said in reply,

"Do not make yourself uneasy, my love	1951.6526
It is a pity they are not handsome! Not that _I_ think
Charlotte so _very_ plain--but then she is our particular friend	723.6549
"

"You have only proved by this," cried Elizabeth, "that Mr	486.6699
She was
sorry that Mr	33482.1338
"Well, mamma," said she, when they were all returned to the breakfast
room, "and what do you think of my husband? Is not he a charming man? I
am sure my sisters must all envy me	573.2339
Collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had passed	179.8909
He repeated the question, with some
surprise at her silence	5817.7287
--Many
stared	816.8057
" She then sat still five
minutes longer; but unable to waste such a precious occasion, she
suddenly got up, and saying to Kitty,

"Come here, my love, I want to speak to you," took her out of the room	2677.3501
Jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the
society of her two friends, and the attentions of their brother; and
Elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr	14728.8555
Not like the wild young men now-a-days, who think of nothing but
themselves	700.0464
The justice of the charge struck her too forcibly
for denial, and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded, as
having passed at the Netherfield ball, and as confirming all his first
disapprobation, could not have made a stronger impression on his mind
than on hers	9741.3465
9	1.0000
The next was in these words	127022.9090
Jane resolutely
kept her place at the table; but Elizabeth, to satisfy her mother, went
to the window--she looked,--she saw Mr	16282.8257
"

No one made any reply	63271.6696

editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U	264.9593
Miss Bingley offered her the carriage, and she only
wanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane testified such concern
in parting with her, that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer
of the chaise into an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the
present	714.5563
Wickham has created, a
     suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his
     real character	1842.9031
Ignorant as you previously were of every thing
     concerning either, detection could not be in your power, and
     suspicion certainly not in your inclination	4827.3223
It was consequently necessary to
name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity; to have
some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed, and by
again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation, console herself for the
present, and prepare for another disappointment	1618.7749
With such rivals for the notice of the fair, as Mr	10744.6968
Nobody can tell what I
suffer!--But it is always so	13452.3153
"Oh! Lizzy, why am I thus singled from my family, and blessed
above them all! If I could but see _you_ as happy! If there _were_ but
such another man for you!"

"If you were to give me forty such men, I never could be so happy as
you	3.2921
Collins and myself on
this happy event, let me now add a short hint on the subject of another:
of which we have been advertised by the same authority	1041.5283
Her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in
her way	1717.4051
"

With such kind of histories of their parties and good jokes, did Lydia,
assisted by Kitty's hints and additions, endeavour to amuse her
companions all the way to Longbourn	1947.3421
"

"And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry? Did he know of
their intending to go off? Had Colonel Forster seen Denny himself?"

"Yes; but when questioned by _him_ Denny denied knowing any thing of
their plan, and would not give his real opinion about it	12704.2253
"He must be an oddity, I think," said she	1491.9969
She is quite a little
creature	208165.0002
He was struggling for the
appearance of composure, and would not open his lips, till he believed
himself to have attained it	827.7813
He is nothing to us, you know, and I am sure
_I_ never want to see him again	1910.3322
"And _that_ I suppose is one of your sisters	831.3590
I was ready to die of laughter	2822.8762
It was reasonable, however, to
hope, that they would not continue long	1209.5955
Darcy, and Lizzy, and Kitty," said Mrs	1409.1329
Of Mr	3703.2383
Collins made his
declaration in form	269.8503
Whatever bears affinity to cunning is
despicable	61.2760
My daughter and my
nephew are formed for each other	4814.2006
While settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound of the
door bell, and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its
being Colonel Fitzwilliam himself, who had once before called late in
the evening, and might now come to enquire particularly after her	5038.0518
I have been a disappointed man, and
my spirits will not bear solitude	1336.3486
"




CHAPTER VI	20961378.5120
Ring the bell,
Kitty, for Hill	825.8015
Our
importance, our respectability in the world, must be affected by the
wild volatility, the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark
Lydia's character	4623.3914

She then ran gaily off, rejoicing as she rambled about, in the hope of
being at home again in a day or two	5692.0491
Darcy, that they scarcely ever saw him	15997.2082
I shall send for my
     clothes when I get to Longbourn; but I wish you would tell Sally
     to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown, before they are
     packed up	2617.5911
I know you will do him such ample justice, that I am
growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent	294.3804
"

Mr	62968.0509
As for Wickham and Lydia, their characters suffered no revolution from
the marriage of her sisters	2853.9566
Mr	112639004.1004
He took the hint,
and when Mary had finished her second song, said aloud,

"That will do extremely well, child	5084.3163
"

"Mr	1110951.7017
I thought I should have broke my heart	1795.7843

understood from the Gardiners that you had	134987.8364
Darcy could be so unworthy of Mr	6570.7017
E	1.0000
She continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of Lady
Catherine's carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter
Charlotte's observation, and hurried her away to her room	4484.9370
Bingley with having promised on his first coming
into the country to give a ball at Netherfield	6320.1394
Kitty is slight and delicate, and Mary studies so much, that her hours
of repose should not be broken in on	228.8527
When all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen,
they returned down stairs, and taking leave of the housekeeper, were
consigned over to the gardener, who met them at the hall door	8672.6192
Bingley, she had likewise seen for an instant, and in that short period
saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed	928.5785
If you should have no objection to receive me
     into your house, I propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on
     you and your family, Monday, November 18th, by four o'clock, and
     shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the Saturday
     se'night following, which I can do without any inconvenience, as
     Lady Catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a
     Sunday, provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the
     duty of the day	1975.2015
The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no
otherwise than by netting a purse, or covering a skreen	1453.8443
"I would not on any
account trifle with her affectionate solicitude; or allow her to hear it
from any one but myself	6007.1169

may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion _of_ him, and _to_ him, too
freely	1614.8129
But I hope you will not mind it: it is
all for Jane's sake, you know; and there is no occasion for talking to
him, except just now and then	3351.9460
Poor
Jane! I am sorry for her, because, with her disposition, she may not get
over it immediately	315.8390
That tall, proud man	703.2693
Reflection must be
reserved for solitary hours; whenever she was alone, she gave way to it
as the greatest relief; and not a day went by without a solitary walk,
in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant
recollections	1326.1959
When first
he entered the corps, she was ready enough to admire him; but so we all
were	9339.0480
She had dressed with more than
usual care, and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all
that remained unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it was not more than
might be won in the course of the evening	892.2119

"But if he returns no more this winter, my choice will never be
required	3742.1008
--But to be guarded at such a time, is
very difficult	3195.0451
But the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man, whom
they had never seen before, of most gentleman-like appearance, walking
with an officer on the other side of the way	4366.7412
Mrs	33109675.6085
"

"My object _then_," replied Darcy, "was to shew you, by every civility
in my power, that I was not so mean as to resent the past; and I hoped
to obtain your forgiveness, to lessen your ill opinion, by letting you
see that your reproofs had been attended to	3866.2336
When the first
transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were
over, he naturally returned to all his former indolence	1271.1343
Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving any
one; and all that I can hope in this case is, that she is deceived
herself	183.8028
From his garden, Mr	40901.1586
Nothing could
console and nothing appease her	140.2169
He still loves me, and we are
engaged	1217.3080
If you and Miss
Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room, I shall be very
thankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me	2616.3871
Robinson's asking him how he liked our Meryton
assemblies, and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty
women in the room, and _which_ he thought the prettiest? and his
answering immediately to the last question--Oh! the eldest Miss Bennet
beyond a doubt, there cannot be two opinions on that point	1598.4461
"I have no reason, I assure you," said he, "to be dissatisfied with my
reception	108.1557
Such relief, however, as it was in her power to afford, by the practice
of what might be called economy in her own private expences, she
frequently sent them	778.8415
Well, if they can be easy with an
estate that is not lawfully their own, so much the better	6654.2256
"They
will join me early to-morrow," he continued, "and among them are some
who will claim an acquaintance with you,--Mr	436.4456
The others then joined her, and expressed their admiration of his
figure; but Elizabeth heard not a word, and, wholly engrossed by her own
feelings, followed them in silence	2678.5402
That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over a
ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the assembly
brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate	16261.2463
Bennet's invention was again at work to get
every body away from him and her daughter	69223.7315
What I have to say relates to
     poor Lydia	3528.2011
It was next to impossible that their cousin should
come in a scarlet coat, and it was now some weeks since they had
received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour	4168.0745
The distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly	13.0916
"If they had uncles enough to fill _all_ Cheapside," cried Bingley, "it
would not make them one jot less agreeable	371.1604
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1	430.9014
" And gravely glancing
at Mr	390.8145
--What advantage can it be to you
to offend Mr	21290.7002
Mr	112639004.1004
Miss Darcy's praise occupied
the chief of it	798.6558
"

"Oh!--you mean Jane, I suppose--because he danced with her twice	16656.3316
"

"Yes, indeed," cried Mrs	2077.1294
Darcy's
sometimes coming there stopped her, and instead of entering the park,
she turned up the lane, which led her farther from the turnpike road	1357.6132
Lady Catherine will not think the worse of you for
being simply dressed	12841.8806
Wickham is the son of a very
     respectable man, who had for many years the management of all the
     Pemberley estates; and whose good conduct in the discharge of his
     trust, naturally inclined my father to be of service to him, and on
     George Wickham, who was his god-son, his kindness was therefore
     liberally bestowed	2867.0883
CHAPTER VII	13914.1137
Darcy is over, I presume," said Miss
Bingley;--"and pray what is the result?"

"I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr	3147.2867
Bennet, who fancied she had gained a complete
victory over him, continued her triumph	5492.8325
In no countenance was attentive
curiosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley's, in spite of the
smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its
objects; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate, and her attentions
to Mr	964.2256
In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother's
words, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible
whisper; for to her inexpressible vexation, she could perceive that the
chief of it was overheard by Mr	2940.0412
"

"I do not believe Mrs	1060.3351
My father and mother knew nothing of that, they only felt how
imprudent a match it must be	1159.2636
On Saturday he came again	1249.3045
After
pausing on this point a considerable while, she once more continued to
read	25094.0163
This idea
lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view; the
turning past, he was immediately before them	965.6674
"If one could but go to Brighton!" observed Mrs	112.3465
The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently
characteristic	415.1095
Collins for
a few moments, he asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation
were very intimately acquainted with the family of de Bourgh	1689.8552
Darcy would connect himself with a family, where to every other
objection would now be added, an alliance and relationship of the
nearest kind with the man whom he so justly scorned	11629.5294
Jane should
therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his
attention	23663.1026
London:
Printed for T	15.1029
"

"I will not be interrupted	86872.2767
_I_ never saw such capacity, and taste, and
application, and elegance, as you describe, united	3693.9835
Her tour to the Lakes
was now the object of her happiest thoughts; it was her best consolation
for all the uncomfortable hours, which the discontentedness of her
mother and Kitty made inevitable; and could she have included Jane in
the scheme, every part of it would have been perfect	3008.8166
She endeavoured to secure Jane in
her interest, but Jane with all possible mildness declined
interfering;--and Elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness and
sometimes with playful gaiety replied to her attacks	2502.9262
"

Elizabeth made no objection;--the door was then allowed to be shut, and
the carriage drove off	3421.5499
Collins and
     myself sincerely sympathise with you, and all your respectable
     family, in your present distress, which must be of the bitterest
     kind, because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove	4875.4077
She had only to say in
reply, that they had wandered about, till she was beyond her own
knowledge	2343.8481
Yet he knew to the contrary himself	149952.7130
He meant to provide for me amply,
and thought he had done it; but when the living fell, it was given
elsewhere	2130.3973
Lydia has no
brothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from my father's
behaviour, from his indolence and the little attention he has ever
seemed to give to what was going forward in his family, that _he_ would
do as little, and think as little about it, as any father could do, in
such a matter	8558.7314
Bennet," said she, "it is very hard to think that Charlotte
Lucas should ever be mistress of this house, that I should be forced to
make way for _her_, and live to see her take my place in it!"

"My dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts	294.1244
"

Not yet, however, in spite of her disappointment in her husband, did
Mrs	846.1767
Jane now came up	4643.6208
His pride, in that direction,
may be of service, if not to himself, to many others, for it must deter
him from such foul misconduct as I have suffered by	11218.0221
The
possibility of meeting Mr	3174.9301
For herself she was humbled; but she was proud of him	3302.5763
Mr	112639004.1004
Her many attractions were again dwelt on, and Caroline
boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy, and ventured to predict
the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former
letter	2761.9159
It was over at last however	12918.6044
"

"There is some sense in what he says about the girls however; and if he
is disposed to make them any amends, I shall not be the person to
discourage him	2887.2010
Elizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused in
attending to what passed between Darcy and his companion	2713.2762
Darcy more than once, but he believes that it was left to
him _conditionally_ only	855.9683
But I can assure the young ladies that I come
prepared to admire them	7695.3476
Philips were now productive of the most interesting
intelligence	2888.7795
"

"You judge very properly," said Mr	2512.6747
I
shall now know how to act	3051.1427
CHAPTER XV	13911.7883
But
     last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice	1687.3357
"Don't keep coughing so, Kitty, for heaven's sake! Have a little
compassion on my nerves	2433.1162
We all love to
instruct, though we can teach only what is not worth knowing	2653.0542
Forster,
the delight of Mrs	644.7791
"

Elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was
the case, and with equal sincerity could add that she firmly believed
and rejoiced in his domestic comforts	582.2867
Wickham, and of seeing a confirmation of every thing in Mr	818.2679
Darcy:--but let me not interrupt you,
Sir	5453.8843
Darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter	2698.2202
With _your_
good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of
others! Affectation of candour is common enough;--one meets it every
where	2625.0522
Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr	69530.0527
The children, two girls of six and eight years old, and two
younger boys, were to be left under the particular care of their cousin
Jane, who was the general favourite, and whose steady sense and
sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every
way--teaching them, playing with them, and loving them	2334.2245
It is not to be supposed
that there was much affection in the case	681.0983
"

This letter gave Elizabeth some pain; but her spirits returned as she
considered that Jane would no longer be duped, by the sister at least	1729.2555
She had
gained her point, and had time to consider of it	23316.2475
There
could not exist in the world _two_ men, over whom Mr	1109.1339
II	1.0000
"

"No--why should he? If it was not allowable for him to gain _my_
affections, because I had no money, what occasion could there be for
making love to a girl whom he did not care about, and who was equally
poor?"

"But there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her, so
soon after this event	1891.9699
But he found, in reply to
     this question, that Wickham still cherished the hope of more
     effectually making his fortune by marriage, in some other country	23533.6738
--How it could occur a second time therefore was
very odd!--Yet it did, and even a third	7424.8809
I roused, and
interested you, because I was so unlike _them_	2826.4452
--He carved, and ate, and praised with delighted
alacrity; and every dish was commended, first by him, and then by Sir
William, who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son in law
said, in a manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear	365.5878
In the hall they parted	54835.1690
It makes me very nervous and poorly, to be thwarted
so in my own family, and to have neighbours who think of themselves
before anybody else	812.5275
But will they make you happy?"

"Have you any other objection," said Elizabeth, "than your belief of my
indifference?"

"None at all	101.8919
By many significant looks and silent
entreaties, did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of
complaisance,--but in vain; Mary would not understand them; such an
opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her, and she began her song	401.1770
You deserve no such attention	24387.7803
Perhaps I am not doing her justice	10009.9024
But, alas! the story which followed of his designs on Miss Darcy,
received some confirmation from what had passed between Colonel
Fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before; and at last she was
referred for the truth of every particular to Colonel Fitzwilliam
himself--from whom she had previously received the information of his
near concern in all his cousin's affairs, and whose character she had no
reason to question	188.6536
Jane listened with astonishment and concern;--she
knew not how to believe that Mr	98385.9563
They repulsed
every attempt of Mrs	4833.9743
Darcy, however, should
have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough, and
she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman, or
the insolent smiles of the ladies, were more intolerable	1570.3317
She was afraid of talking longer of his
friend; and, having nothing else to say, was now determined to leave the
trouble of finding a subject to him	18003.8294
"He is as fine a fellow," said Mr	4023.4181
"

Miss Bingley made no answer; and soon afterwards got up and walked about
the room	1394.7711
Are you quite sure that you feel what you ought
to do?"

"Oh, yes! You will only think I feel _more_ than I ought to do, when I
tell you all	6340.0509
That he is
as false and deceitful, as he is insinuating	8173.2338
If I were not afraid of judging harshly, I should
     be almost tempted to say, that there is a strong appearance of
     duplicity in all this	746.1746
They soon outstripped the others, and when they had
reached the carriage, Mr	1717.4603
The business was therefore soon settled	40461.0447
"

"I think you said she was a widow, sir? has she any family?"

"She has one only daughter, the heiress of Rosings, and of very
extensive property	5436.9333
A fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de
Bourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant; and the respect which he
felt for her high rank, and his veneration for her as his patroness,
mingling with a very good opinion of himself, of his authority as a
clergyman, and his rights as a rector, made him altogether a mixture of
pride and obsequiousness, self-importance and humility	2119.2869
"They have both," said she, "been deceived, I dare say, in some way or
other, of which we can form no idea	1235.8110
He had found the law a most unprofitable study,
     and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained, if I would
     present him to the living in question--of which he trusted there
     could be little doubt, as he was well assured that I had no other
     person to provide for, and I could not have forgotten my revered
     father's intentions	7125.1813
Mrs	33109675.6085
The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States	1212.4305
Darcy just deigned to return	28755.5256
Their reception from Mr	6373.8391
Gardiner? He has been here
this half hour, and master has had a letter	15471.6545
He is rich, to be
sure, and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than Jane	223.4085
Reynolds
was of no trifling nature	4379.6082
You have no compassion on my poor nerves	8724.8089
CHAPTER V	13781.8794
The church _ought_ to have been my profession--I
was brought up for the church, and I should at this time have been in
possession of a most valuable living, had it pleased the gentleman we
were speaking of just now	3108.2600
Accordingly, when she retired at night, she asked the chambermaid
whether Pemberley were not a very fine place, what was the name of its
proprietor, and with no little alarm, whether the family were down for
the summer	7475.9300
Mr	112639004.1004
Bingley was by no means deficient,
but Darcy was clever	1261.7463
This is my advice	11978.3264
Why does she not come in?"

"Oh! Charlotte says, she hardly ever does	705.4879
In anticipating the happiness of Bingley,
which of course was to be inferior only to his own, he continued the
conversation till they reached the house	9612.7516
I should be sorry, you know,
to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in Derbyshire	141.8135
I cannot find
out that I hate her at all, or that I am in the least unwilling to think
her a very good sort of girl	1259.6274
I really do not think Georgiana
Darcy has her equal for beauty, elegance, and accomplishments; and the
affection she inspires in Louisa and myself, is heightened into
something still more interesting, from the hope we dare to entertain of
her being hereafter our sister	4213.8561
and
Mrs	37333.7087
Darcy, who never looks at any
woman but to see a blemish, and who probably never looked at _you_ in
his life! It is admirable!"

Elizabeth tried to join in her father's pleasantry, but could only force
one most reluctant smile	995.8431
They will have nothing else to
do	10290.2251
Had she merely _dined_ with him, she might
only have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you must
remember that four evenings have been also spent together--and four
evenings may do a great deal	746.4031
"

"But if you have got them to-day," said Elizabeth, "my mother's purpose
will be answered	923.8895
"

"Mr	1110951.7017
As her successor in that house, she
regarded her with jealous abhorrence	1409.5011
When the engagement was for home, some of the officers always
made part of it, of which officers Mr	1411.1866
--Pray, what is your age?"

"With three younger sisters grown up," replied Elizabeth smiling, "your
Ladyship can hardly expect me to own it	2944.7453
He spoke of it as a certain event,
     of which the time alone could be undecided	57004.3941
"She is so fond of Mrs	45638.8823
But whatever may be the sentiments which Mr	7856.2143
Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabeth
again, having still a great deal to say to her, and many enquiries to
make after all their Hertfordshire friends	3060.1137
The Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the
world, though only a few weeks before, when Lydia had first run away,
they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune	1240.9651
"

Then, perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying, she added,
"Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia, we may draw from it this useful
lesson; that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable--that one false
step involves her in endless ruin--that her reputation is no less
brittle than it is beautiful,--and that she cannot be too much guarded
in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex	1333.5524
She felt that she had no business at
Pemberley, and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it	213.1832
In this danger Kitty
is also comprehended	141.6336
Recovering himself, however, shortly,
he turned to his partner, and said,

"Sir William's interruption has made me forget what we were talking of	1881.8017
Collins was first introduced to her
notice, but he certainly has not known her long	94572.4206
Bingley's attentions to her sister, Elizabeth
was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some
interest in the eyes of his friend	1546.3621
In Three Volumes	651.9311
Darcy with him, and sat down
again by her sister	1267.7497
I must confess myself
     surprised by your application; I did not expect it from _you_	6352.0652
"While Mary is adjusting her ideas," he continued, "let us return to Mr	817.1382
One seems so forlorn without them	17.1743
"

"Indeed you are mistaken	314024.1607
With assumed tranquillity he then replied, "I have no wish of denying
that I did every thing in my power to separate my friend from your
sister, or that I rejoice in my success	1112.9942
"

Mr	62968.0509
Darcy were by no means over	8017.9374
Bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for Lydia's
interruption, and promised that it should not occur again, if he would
resume his book; but Mr	781.3988
Mr	112639004.1004
Darcy; the latter of whom, however,
could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of _her_, in spite of
all Miss Bingley's witticisms on _fine eyes_	905.4913
"

Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it, and
they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put
an end to cards; and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr	2268.3713
Wickham is safe	73073.4048
--Your mother will never see you
again if you do _not_ marry Mr	931.7718
But perhaps Mr	1226.6594
Darcy had at first scarcely
allowed her to be pretty; he had looked at her without admiration at the
ball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise	3749.6733
All the world are good and agreeable
in your eyes	4861.9094
gutenberg	13713973.6366
--Miss Darcy, the daughter of Mr	18694.5897
E	1.0000
Bennet rejoiced to see Jane
in undiminished beauty; and more than once during dinner did Mr	876.8746
Collins for the knowledge of what carriages went
along, and how often especially Miss De Bourgh drove by in her phaeton,
which he never failed coming to inform them of, though it happened
almost every day	5672.6610
Into _one_ house in this
neighbourhood, they shall never have admittance	2204.1950
Darcy had been at her
sister's wedding	552.1302
These
were the contents:

     "MY DEAR HARRIET,

     "You will laugh when you know where I am gone, and I cannot help
     laughing myself at your surprise to-morrow morning, as soon as I am
     missed	1323.4119
So imprudent a
     match on both sides!--But I am willing to hope the best, and that
     his character has been misunderstood	4776.9217
She answered in the affirmative, and, unable to resist
the temptation, added, "When you met us there the other day, we had just
been forming a new acquaintance	1287.6400
Bennet, was not so well pleased with it	56327.7636
My dear Jane, Mr	4706.2819
I must find Mr	9206.3791
My courage always rises with every attempt to
intimidate me	60.3723
GARDINER	785771.7608
Her father was walking about the room, looking grave and anxious	6370.9799
Pray go to see them, with Sir William and Maria	24622.5311
Such very
superior dancing is not often seen	31045.4276
Bennet's expectations were fully answered	30.0777
Jenkinson was
arranging Miss de Bourgh's foot-stool, that she said, 'Mr	251.1363
"You either chuse this method of passing
the evening because you are in each other's confidence and have secret
affairs to discuss, or because you are conscious that your figures
appear to the greatest advantage in walking;--if the first, I should be
completely in your way;--and if the second, I can admire you much better
as I sit by the fire	2848.8363
"

But Jane could think with certainty on only one point,--that Mr	14496.7441
Collins and Lizzy	950.9257
"

"No," said Colonel Fitzwilliam, "that is an advantage which he must
divide with me	1967.9911
Believe her to be deceived by all means	1175.8425
gutenberg	13713973.6366
I have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will
include you and my sister Maria in every invitation with which she
honours us during your stay here	1839.0073
"

"Nay, if you are so serious about it, I shall consider the matter as
absolutely settled	2763.3485
"

"It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire	1867.9273
I cannot think of it without abhorrence	95.0472
Collins met for breakfast a few
minutes before the others appeared; and he took the opportunity of
paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary	1324.1133
--"Louisa, you will not mind my
waking Mr	975.4073

Mrs	47234646.3654
"Do
you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on
them, as nonsense? I cannot quite agree with you _there_	4492.6363
Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday; on Tuesday, his wife received a
letter from him; it told them, that on his arrival, he had immediately
found out his brother, and persuaded him to come to Gracechurch street	3728.8281
With a
book he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had a
good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised
such splendid expectations	1209.4278
But
Lizzy, you have been very sly, very reserved with me	2190.1691
They have at
least that advantage	7963.1186
As soon as they entered the copse, Lady Catherine began in the following
manner:--

"You can be at no loss, Miss Bennet, to understand the reason of my
journey hither	3725.0188
Bennet
was restored to her usual querulous serenity, and by the middle of June
Kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton without
tears; an event of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth hope, that by
the following Christmas, she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to
mention an officer above once a day, unless by some cruel and malicious
arrangement at the war-office, another regiment should be quartered in
Meryton	1527.5909
Collins, was convinced that
they were talking of the Longbourn estate, and resolving to turn herself

Indeed, Mr	242432.0843
Elizabeth soon heard from her friend; and their
correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been; that it
should be equally unreserved was impossible	2073.1228
It was
generally evident whenever they met, that he _did_ admire her; and to
_her_ it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference
which she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a
way to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that it
was not likely to be discovered by the world in general, since Jane
united with great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and a
uniform cheerfulness of manner, which would guard her from the
suspicions of the impertinent	2795.8831
E	1.0000
But in all, and in almost every line of each, there was a want of that
cheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style, and which,
proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself, and kindly
disposed towards every one, had been scarcely ever clouded	8368.6488
"

"Insolent girl!" said Elizabeth to herself	13349.6728
Your
     father was gone, your uncle at home, and, as I said before, they

Her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what
she did not believe herself, that his attentions to Jane had been merely
the effect of a common and transient liking, which ceased when he saw
her no more; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at
the time, she had the same story to repeat every day	7877.1642
"

"You have a very small park here," returned Lady Catherine after a short
silence	1616.1579
The family were assembled in the breakfast room, to receive
them	164283.7947
She was met in the vestibule by Lydia, who, flying to
her, cried in a half whisper, "I am glad you are come, for there is such
fun here!--What do you think has happened this morning?--Mr	1077.5304
Darcy," observed Miss Bingley, in a half whisper,
"that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine
eyes	199.7054
I have known him
too long and too well to be a fair judge	2760.7300
He shall not be in love with me, if I
can prevent it	859.2417
Bennet, and
we shall very soon settle it with her, I am sure	174.9934
Mr	112639004.1004
Darcy's explanation
_there_, had appeared very insufficient; and she read it again	13648.1497
That among his own connections he was
esteemed and valued--that even Wickham had allowed him merit as a
brother, and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of
his sister as to prove him capable of _some_ amiable feeling	3917.5048
"I am by no means of opinion, I assure you," said he, "that a ball of
this kind, given by a young man of character, to respectable people, can
have any evil tendency; and I am so far from objecting to dancing myself
that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins
in the course of the evening, and I take this opportunity of soliciting
yours, Miss Elizabeth, for the two first dances especially,--a
preference which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right
cause, and not to any disrespect for her	2220.1038
Do let me ask my partner to introduce you	36379.2322
Jane was already so much recovered
as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening	220.7561
"

"I beg your pardon	1574.5204
Any thing beyond
the very neighbourhood of Longbourn, I suppose, would appear far	1646.9694
It settled the matter; and they pursued the accustomed
circuit; which brought them again, after some time, in a descent among
hanging woods, to the edge of the water, in one of its narrowest parts	971.3676

But how came you to tell us that he was so
disagreeable?"

Elizabeth excused herself as well as she could; said that she had liked
him better when they met in Kent than before, and that she had never
seen him so pleasant as this morning	4083.7595

Mr	112639004.1004
There was certainly at this moment, in Elizabeth's mind, a more gentle
sensation towards the original, than she had ever felt in the height of
their acquaintance	4854.9128
What sister would think
herself at liberty to do it, unless there were something very
objectionable? If they believed him attached to me, they would not try
to part us; if he were so, they could not succeed	2214.8240

strongly as now, the disadvantages which must attend the children of so
unsuitable a marriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils
arising from so ill-judged a direction of talents; talents which rightly
used, might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters,

of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien; and
the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after
his entrance, of his having ten thousand a year	7662.0709
Darcy before they
had known any thing of the matter	127836.4138
I happened to overhear the
gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of
this house the names of his cousin Miss de Bourgh, and of her mother
Lady Catherine	980.2720
Jenkinson to make up her
party	6176.0654
Bennet, with great civility, begged her ladyship to take some
refreshment; but Lady Catherine very resolutely, and not very politely,
declined eating any thing; and then rising up, said to Elizabeth,

"Miss Bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness
on one side of your lawn	1598.9742

composure	6628.4336
--Come, Kitty, I want you up stairs	14210.8706
He was writing, and, without raising his head,
coolly replied,

even mention that gentleman	3156.6582

of the pictures, the dimensions of the rooms, and the price of the
furniture, in vain	7322.5927
Miss
Bingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the
first opportunity of saying, with sneering civility,

"Pray, Miss Eliza, are not the ----shire militia removed from Meryton?
They must be a great loss to _your_ family	8490.8331

Elizabeth's collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emotion; and
as Miss Bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not approach nearer to
Wickham, Georgiana also recovered in time, though not enough to be able
to speak any more	710.0476

Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to

others, and she had no opportunity of detaining them	549.5865
"

"My dear Jane!" exclaimed Elizabeth, "you are too good	1080.4909
She had a sister married to a Mr	72604.3952

"I wish I could say any thing to comfort you," replied Elizabeth; "but
it is wholly out of my power	34404.0729
Her answer, therefore, was not propitious, at
least not to Elizabeth's wishes, for she was impatient to get home	31796.6959
"It was greatly my wish that he should do so," he added, "as soon
     as his marriage was fixed on	4795.4269
You refuse, then, to oblige me	12206.8170
Gardiner and
her niece, however, did her justice, and pitied her	3739.8464
Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield
party	2479.3688
That _she_ could
be in any danger from the deception never entered my head	16574.8804
"He
only told me, what I have now told you	565.8178
From something that he told me in
our journey hither, I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted to
him	5456.7535
Once or twice she could discern a faint blush; but in general
Charlotte wisely did not hear	97.3235
"

It was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that embarrassment,
from which she had been so wholly free at first	1100.3879
Though I
_know_ it must be a scandalous falsehood; though I would not injure him
so much as to suppose the truth of it possible, I instantly resolved on
setting off for this place, that I might make my sentiments known to
you	6811.3839
He even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity	78.1435
And now nothing
remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the
violence of my affection	1475.7076
Darcy then
was	149989.8557
_I_ should be
ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me	196478.7550
Her dirty petticoat
quite escaped my notice	16.1216
And
     will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances
     to his creditors in Meryton, of whom I shall subjoin a list,
     according to his information	935.9519
He had entertained hopes of being
admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he had heard
much; but he saw only the father	1519.8526
Perhaps I
did not always love him so well as I do now	16729.8992
But I am particularly
attached to these young men; and know them to be so much attached to
me!--They were excessively sorry to go! But so they always are	8886.5581
Lady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew;
and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character, in
her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement, she sent him
language so very abusive, especially of Elizabeth, that for some time
all intercourse was at an end	648.4568
"

Consoled by this resolution, she was the better able to bear her
husband's incivility; though it was very mortifying to know that her
neighbours might all see Mr	1056.4448
All that is known after this is, that they were seen
     to continue the London road	641.1900
"Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs	578.1445
Very little was said by either; Kitty was
too much afraid of him to talk; Elizabeth was secretly forming a
desperate resolution; and perhaps he might be doing the same	2205.7705
They were ignorant, idle, and vain	1849.2040
Miss Bingley's letter arrived, and put an end to doubt	30210.0152
Could she have seen half as much love in Mr	19354.3312
Mrs	33109675.6085
"

"What think you of books?" said he, smiling	6705.3290
They
had all been very ill-used since she last saw her sister	1841.9340
Bennet gone away, and I know he will fight
Wickham, wherever he meets him, and then he will be killed, and what is
to become of us all? The Collinses will turn us out, before he is cold
in his grave; and if you are not kind to us, brother, I do not know what
we shall do	1648.7866
"

Elizabeth's misery increased, at such unnecessary, such officious
attention! Were the same fair prospect to arise at present, as had
flattered them a year ago, every thing, she was persuaded, would be
hastening to the same vexatious conclusion	1140.6457
Darcy's behaviour astonished and vexed her	11216.7023
Four nieces
of Mrs	1594.9491
Every body is disgusted with his pride	13471.3262
Their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she could
regard with any complacency	1358.1063
"

"Can such abominable pride as his, have ever done him good?"

"Yes	12601.6270
The whole of what Elizabeth had already
heard, his claims on Mr	202548.7972
"

"I did not think you would;--and that being the case, I cannot consider
your situation with much compassion	30058.8902
"

But Elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with them,
laughingly answered,

"No, no; stay where you are	1993.1826
"

Elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he afterwards
took occasion to ask her, when unattended to by any of the rest,
whether _all_ her sisters were at Longbourn	1714.9433
--But
     from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally
     bestowed, respecting each circumstance, I shall hope to be in
     future secured, when the following account of my actions and their
     motives has been read	430.2670
CHAPTER X	13914.1137
"There
is nothing the matter with me	507.2553
At first there
seemed danger of Lydia's engrossing him entirely, for she was a most
determined talker; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets,
she soon grew too much interested in the game, too eager in making bets
and exclaiming after prizes, to have attention for any one in
particular	1166.0885
Bennet, "you
will wait on him of course	4155.2267
--Oh! had I known what
I ought, what I dared, to do! But I knew not--I was afraid of doing too
much	5.4957
A
most delightful place!--Excellent Parsonage House! It would have suited
me in every respect	169.9366
--Pursuing her way along the lane, she then began it	1905.9014
Bennet, have you no more lanes
hereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her way again to-day?"

"I advise Mr	1481.2839
With the kindest concern he
     came on to Longbourn, and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner
     most creditable to his heart	2734.9011
"

"I am talking of possibilities, Charles	5529.7161
She now lost every expectation of pleasure	17644.9883
"

"Yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near Cheapside	17180.0080
They contained no actual complaint, nor was there any
revival of past occurrences, or any communication of present suffering	66.2353
"

"I must think your language too strong in speaking of both," replied
Jane, "and I hope you will be convinced of it, by seeing them happy
together	772.7298
' Allow me, by the
way, to observe, my fair cousin, that I do not reckon the notice and
kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the
advantages in my power to offer	2133.8247
The recollection of what I
then said, of my conduct, my manners, my expressions during the whole of
it, is now, and has been many months, inexpressibly painful to me	31646.0733
His behaviour to myself has been
scandalous; but I verily believe I could forgive him any thing and every
thing, rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory
of his father	1117.6827
"

Another intreaty that she would be serious, however, produced the
desired effect; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn assurances of
attachment	2785.3841
Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so--but still they admired
her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and one whom
they should not object to know more of	2060.6506
I depend on you for that	2407907.2527
Elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had, from the distress of
the moment, been led to make Mr	6469.2828
Darcy?"

"As much as I ever wish to be," cried Elizabeth warmly,--"I have spent
four days in the same house with him, and I think him very
disagreeable	4.1208
Bennet," as she entered the room, "we have had a most
delightful evening, a most excellent ball	1284.1155
"

Her performance was pleasing, though by no means capital	3955.9151
Elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her
delight in the prospect of their relationship	4935.4413
"I have found out," said he, "by a singular accident, that there is now
in the room a near relation of my patroness	412.0423
She had scarcely needed her
present observation to be satisfied, from the reason of things, that
their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love, rather
than by his; and she would have wondered why, without violently caring
for her, he chose to elope with her at all, had she not felt certain
that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances; and
if that were the case, he was not the young man to resist an opportunity
of having a companion	3702.9881
What made you so shy of me, when you first
called, and afterwards dined here? Why, especially, when you called, did
you look as if you did not care about me?"

"Because you were grave and silent, and gave me no encouragement	354.6571
"

Elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement, but was too much oppressed to
make any reply	2037.0359
Denny had
brought him from London, and that he was to have a lieutenant's
commission in the ----shire	274.7105
He began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too much attention	27087.4232
Never mind Miss
Lizzy's hair	148.6198
E	1.0000
Your tempers are by no means unlike	185.7911
She answered him with cold civility	10267.3382
Darcy they had
only seen at church	138230.2355
How you must have hated me after _that_ evening?"

"Hate you! I was angry perhaps at first, but my anger soon began to take
a proper direction	127.3862
Collins,
was a most humiliating picture!--And to the pang of a friend disgracing
herself and sunk in her esteem, was added the distressing conviction
that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot
she had chosen	1495.2646
But as to your
other objection, I am afraid it will hardly hold good	6916.0568
But Jane and Elizabeth, who
agreed in wishing, for the sake of their sister's feelings and
consequence, that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents,
urged him so earnestly, yet so rationally and so mildly, to receive her
and her husband at Longbourn, as soon as they were married, that he was
prevailed on to think as they thought, and act as they wished	1228.8713
His revenge would have been complete indeed	319.3389
"

She did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses
were engaged	7930.1026
When they repaired to the
dining-room, Elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether Bingley would take
the place, which, in all their former parties, had belonged to him, by
her sister	13510.1029

And pray, Lizzy, what said Lady Catherine
about this report? Did she call to refuse her consent?"

To this question his daughter replied only with a laugh; and as it had
been asked without the least suspicion, she was not distressed by his
repeating it	1483.4103
"My dear Madam," he replied, "this invitation is particularly
gratifying, because it is what I have been hoping to receive; and you

Philips was always glad to see her nieces, and the two eldest, from

Mr	112639004.1004
"I can comprehend your going on charmingly, when
you had once made a beginning; but what could set you off in the first

"I cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the words, which

Hurst and Miss Bingley, and the lady with whom she lived in
