"

"Their conduct has been such," replied Elizabeth, "as neither you, nor
I, nor any body, can ever forget	6.8934
--Elizabeth instantly read her feelings, and at that moment
solicitude for Wickham, resentment against his enemies, and every thing
else gave way before the hope of Jane's being in the fairest way for
happiness	1.8631
Collins! my dear Charlotte,--impossible!"

The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her
story, gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a
reproach; though, as it was no more than she expected, she soon
regained her composure, and calmly replied,

"Why should you be surprised, my dear Eliza?--Do you think it incredible
that Mr	1.0000
I quite detest the man	1.0000
"You have no regard, then, for the honour and credit of my nephew!
Unfeeling, selfish girl! Do you not consider that a connection with you,
must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody?"

"Lady Catherine, I have nothing farther to say	4.6416
Her figure was elegant, and she walked well;--but Darcy, at
whom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly studious	1.0000
"

"I do, I do like him," she replied, with tears in her eyes, "I love him	23.0950
They have each their
advantages, and I can be equally happy in either	6.8112
Though suspicion was very far
from Miss Bennet's general habits, she was absolutely incredulous here	4.6407

Gardiner's
long letter, but now, having _that_ to communicate which she knew would
be most welcome, she was almost ashamed to find, that her uncle and aunt
had already lost three days of happiness, and immediately wrote as
follows:

     "I would have thanked you before, my dear aunt, as I ought to have
     done, for your long, kind, satisfactory, detail of particulars; but
     to say the truth, I was too cross to write	4.9846
They could
not be untouched by his politeness, and had they drawn his character
from their own feelings, and his servant's report, without any reference
to any other account, the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known,
would not have recognised it for Mr	1.0000

address most truly the gentleman	2.8477
"

"I will not trust myself on the subject," replied Wickham, "_I_ can
hardly be just to him	8.9615
When he was gone, they were certain at least of receiving constant
information of what was going on, and their uncle promised, at parting,
to prevail on Mr	1.0000
gutenberg	1.0000
Bennet's leaving them together, after a
longer irritation than usual about Netherfield and its master, she could
not help saying,

"Oh! that my dear mother had more command over herself; she can have no
idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him	7.9855

know whether he would be married in his blue coat	1.0000

she wished or feared it most, she could scarcely determine	2.3460

"_You_ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room," said Mr	21.5400
Gardiner, whose curiosity
as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive	1.0000
Hurst had therefore nothing to do, but to stretch himself on one of the
sophas and go to sleep	3.5938
Gardiner would be prevented by business from
setting out till a fortnight later in July, and must be in London again
within a month; and as that left too short a period for them to go so
far, and see so much as they had proposed, or at least to see it with
the leisure and comfort they had built on, they were obliged to give up
the Lakes, and substitute a more contracted tour; and, according to the
present plan, were to go no farther northward than Derbyshire	2.0533

Gardiner and the children were to remain in Hertfordshire a few
days longer, as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to
her nieces	1.0000
But, perhaps his sister does as well
for the present, and, as she is under his sole care, he may do what he
likes with her	11.7839
Bennet, "but it is a comfort to think that, whatever of
that kind may befal you, you have an affectionate mother who will always
make the most of it	86.1621
Collins would have led them round his two meadows,
but the ladies not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white
frost, turned back; and while Sir William accompanied him, Charlotte
took her sister and friend over the house, extremely well pleased,
probably, to have the opportunity of shewing it without her husband's
help	1.0000
I came to try you	2152.3049
W	1.0000
After a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with

"It is _your_ turn to say something now, Mr	2.8477
March was to take
Elizabeth to Hunsford	1.0000
"

"He is a sweet tempered, amiable, charming man	1.0000
Morris immediately; that he is
to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be
in the house by the end of next week	5.5036
Had he done his duty in that
respect, Lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle, for whatever of
honour or credit could now be purchased for her	1.0000
"

"It is more than I engage for, I assure you	65.7925
The
subject was pursued no farther, and the gentlemen soon afterwards went
away	46.3929
But now she would no longer
conceal from her, his share in Lydia's marriage	1.0000
--The envelope itself was likewise
full	1.0000
He heard her attentively, and then said,

"Lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public
place or other, and we can never expect her to do it with so little
expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present
circumstances	2.6100
Wickham	1.0000
And it is the more to be lamented, because there is reason to
     suppose, as my dear Charlotte informs me, that this licentiousness
     of behaviour in your daughter, has proceeded from a faulty degree
     of indulgence, though, at the same time, for the consolation of
     yourself and Mrs	3.8267
"

Then turning to Mr	1.0000
Bingley comes, my dear," said Mrs	1264.6942
From the farther disadvantage of Lydia's
society she was of course carefully kept, and though Mrs	1.0000
--The
possibility of his having really endured such unkindness, was enough to
interest all her tender feelings; and nothing therefore remained to be
done, but to think well of them both, to defend the conduct of each, and
throw into the account of accident or mistake, whatever could not be
otherwise explained	3.3593
It does not necessarily follow that a deep,
intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours	9.9970
Bennet, who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the
affair as she wished, was excessively disappointed	15.0105
Now and then, they were honoured with a call from her Ladyship,
and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during
these visits	5.8773
Had Lydia's marriage been
concluded on the most honourable terms, it was not to be supposed that
Mr	15.2298
"This is a parade," cried he, "which does one good; it gives such an
elegance to misfortune! Another day I will do the same; I will sit in
my library, in my night cap and powdering gown, and give as much trouble
as I can,--or, perhaps, I may defer it, till Kitty runs away	3.7812
--Lady Catherine was a tall, large woman, with
strongly-marked features, which might once have been handsome	3.5932
"Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?" said Miss Bingley; "will
she be as tall as I am?"

"I think she will	1.0000
Such I was, from eight to eight and twenty; and such I might
still have been but for you, dearest, loveliest Elizabeth! What do I not
owe you! You taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most
advantageous	1.0000
"

"You must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that your
refusal of my addresses is merely words of course	6.8120
At such a distance as _that_, you know, things are strangely
misrepresented	46.4042
Bennet, "to walk
to Oakham Mount this morning	17.7827
The hill, crowned with wood, from
which they had descended, receiving increased abruptness from the
distance, was a beautiful object	1.0000
It adds even another motive	1.0000
He joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their
aunt's, where his regret and vexation, and the concern of every body was
well talked over	1.0000

know	1.0000
CHAPTER XVI	1.0000
Collins's conversation to herself	1.0000
"I told you the other day,
of his infamous behaviour to Mr	6.8129
Reynolds, either
from pride or attachment, had evidently great pleasure in talking of her
master and his sister	1.0000
When the ladies were separating for the toilette, he said to Elizabeth,

"Do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your apparel	34.5430
Bingley and Jane, however, soon allowed the others to
outstrip them	11.7657
I want to talk very seriously	315.9933
Till I was in Kent, and saw
so much both of Mr	1.0000
"

Away ran the girls, too eager to get in to have time for speech	1.0000
"

She would not give him time to reply, but hurrying instantly to her
husband, called out as she entered the library,

"Oh! Mr	5.8767
6	1.0000
She had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of his
being partial to her, but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea; and Mrs	2.5116
"

"We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that
evening," said Elizabeth	3.5938
He had never before supposed
that, could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter, it would be
done with so little inconvenience to himself, as by the present
arrangement	9.2832
This was his plan of amends--of atonement--for inheriting their father's
estate; and he thought it an excellent one, full of eligibility and
suitableness, and excessively generous and disinterested on his own
part	1.0000
Darcy's
shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict, gave her a
keener sense of her sister's sufferings	8.9602
Gardiner	1.0000
"
Charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful, and
that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time	2.7213

Forster to Meryton,
from whence they were to set out early the next morning	1.0000

and all was soon right again	8.9602
YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE	1.6875
"

"He likes to have his own way very well," replied Colonel Fitzwilliam	1.0000
Elizabeth received her
congratulations amongst the rest, and then, sick of this folly, took
refuge in her own room, that she might think with freedom	5.5042
The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every
female of the family	5.8767
--Are you much acquainted with Mr	1.0000
"

"Such as vanity and pride	1.0000
Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my
positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand; for I
have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the
blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation	2.6636
The families who had been in town for the winter came
back again, and summer finery and summer engagements arose	3.3593
It was an evening of no common delight to them all; the satisfaction of
Miss Bennet's mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face, as
made her look handsomer than ever	3.7273
"

"Oh! it is of no consequence	0.6831
CHAPTER XII	1.0000
_Your_
retrospections must be so totally void of reproach, that the contentment
arising from them, is not of philosophy, but what is much better, of
ignorance	1.0000
Proud that in a cause of compassion and honour, he had been able to get
the better of himself	15.4841
"Why, if he came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent," said she,
"did he come at all?"

She could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure	5.9209
I shall walk to Meryton to-morrow to hear more
about it, and to ask when Mr	1.0000
Oh! he is the handsomest young man that
ever was seen!"

Wickham, Lydia, were all forgotten	1.0000
If I may so express it, he has a _right_
to be proud	1.0000
It
gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast; for she was in
no cheerful humour	15.0079
Till this moment, I never knew myself	1.0000
"Oh! Mary," said she, "I wish you had gone with us, for we had such fun!
as we went along, Kitty and me drew up all the blinds, and pretended
there was nobody in the coach; and I should have gone so all the way, if
Kitty had not been sick; and when we got to the George, I do think we
behaved very handsomely, for we treated the other three with the nicest
cold luncheon in the world, and if you would have gone, we would have
treated you too	1.1250
You know my sentiments	99851.7530
Collins has yet
expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us, but I am very
certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for
it	10.8241
Bennet was really in a most pitiable state	1.0000
It was a painful, but
not an improbable, conjecture	12.9155
Collins wants to marry Lizzy?"

Nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne
without anger such treatment; but Sir William's good breeding carried
him through it all; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the
truth of his information, he listened to all their impertinence with the
most forbearing courtesy	1.0000
I do not wish to avoid the walk	46.4158
--No one who has ever seen you
together, can doubt his affection	1.0000
Collins's respectability, and
Charlotte's prudent, steady character	1.0000
She wanted to ascertain the
feelings of each of her visitors, she wanted to compose her own, and to
make herself agreeable to all; and in the latter object, where she
feared most to fail, she was most sure of success, for those to whom she
endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour	3.2243
She had
got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight,
and was certain of a willing listener in Jane, whenever she might wish
to talk again of either	1.9305
Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1	1.0000
"

He listened to her with perfect indifference, while she chose to
entertain herself in this manner, and as his composure convinced her
that all was safe, her wit flowed long	2.0535
"I have not the pleasure of understanding you," said he, when she had
finished her speech	180.4564
In
confirmation of this, she related the particulars of all the pecuniary
transactions in which they had been connected, without actually naming
her authority, but stating it to be such as might be relied on	1.8956
Bennet give up the point	1.0000
Lydia--the
humiliation, the misery, she was bringing on them all, soon swallowed up
every private care; and covering her face with her handkerchief,
Elizabeth was soon lost to every thing else; and, after a pause of
several minutes, was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the
voice of her companion, who, in a manner, which though it spoke
compassion, spoke likewise restraint, said, "I am afraid you have been
long desiring my absence, nor have I any thing to plead in excuse of my
stay, but real, though unavailing, concern	4.3735
Lady Catherine was reckoned proud by many
people he knew, but _he_ had never seen any thing but affability in her	1.0000
"

"And this," cried Darcy, as he walked with quick steps across the room,
"is your opinion of me! This is the estimation in which you hold me! I
thank you for explaining it so fully	6.8112
I congratulate her	1.0000
Hurst, who had
married a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider
his house as her home when it suited her	1.0000
Her enquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered	1.0000
They were in ----
     street	315.9933
Lady Lucas began directly to calculate with more
interest than the matter had ever excited before, how many years longer

But enough of this	1.0000
But if I go on, I shall displease you by saying what
I think of persons you esteem	1.0000
The vicious propensities--the
     want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge
     of his best friend, could not escape the observation of a young man
     of nearly the same age with himself, and who had opportunities of
     seeing him in unguarded moments, which Mr	6.7353
Bennet could not give her consent, or
speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings,
though she talked to Bingley of nothing else, for half an hour; and when
Mr	7.1956
org/files/42671/42671-h	1.0000
Mrs	1.0000
The respect created by the conviction of his
valuable qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some
time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings; and it was now heightened
into somewhat of a friendlier nature, by the testimony so highly in his
favour, and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light,
which yesterday had produced	1.4412
CHAPTER XI	1.0000
The suspicions which had just
arisen of Mr	1.0000
I am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just
said, and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long	1.0000
--Elizabeth took leave of
the whole party in the liveliest spirits	10.0000
"How abominable!--I wonder that the very
pride of this Mr	1.0000
From the entrance hall, of which Mr	1.0000
Elizabeth, equally
next to Jane in birth and beauty, succeeded her of course	1.0000
Darcy should hear the
first raptures of her joy, than the first vehemence of her
disapprobation	1.0000
To Elizabeth it appeared, that had her family made an agreement to
expose themselves as much as they could during the evening, it would
have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit, or
finer success; and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister
that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice, and that his
feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he
must have witnessed	3.0331
He was her dear Wickham on every
occasion; no one was to be put in competition with him	1.0000
She was not sorry, however, to
have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from
whom they sprung	28.6860
Unfortunately an only son, (for many years an only _child_)
I was spoilt by my parents, who though good themselves, (my father
particularly, all that was benevolent and amiable,) allowed, encouraged,
almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing, to care for none beyond
my own family circle, to think meanly of all the rest of the world, to
_wish_ at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with
my own	1.7083
But when you have had time to think it all over, I hope you
will be satisfied with what I have done	3.1128
Of course, we hope that you will support the Project

Bingley's chaise to go to Meryton;
and the Hursts have no horses to theirs	5.1784
When the gentlemen rose to go away, Mrs	26.8156
Darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone for those
casual errors, under which she would endeavour to class, what Mr	2.4242
"

Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to
continue the subject	5.1784
"

"And of your infliction," cried Elizabeth with energy	14.9203
"

Jane shook her head	1.0000
If he is satisfied with only regretting me, when he might
have obtained my affections and hand, I shall soon cease to regret him
at all	2.4242
We have judged it best, that my
     niece should be married from this house, of which I hope you will
     approve	8.9602
"He is indeed--but considering the inducement, my dear Miss Eliza, we
cannot wonder at his complaisance; for who would object to such a
partner?"

Elizabeth looked archly, and turned away	10.8262
I cannot
     understand it	4636991.0502
Miss Lucas is married and settled	1.0000
Elizabeth, as she affectionately embraced her, whilst tears filled the
eyes of both, lost not a moment in asking whether any thing had been
heard of the fugitives	2.2120
Bennet	1.0000
Follies
and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies _do_ divert me, I own, and I
laugh at them whenever I can	3.1618
"I hope," added Mrs	435.7364
She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear
of seeing Mr	8.1091
"

"May I ask to what these questions tend?"

"Merely to the illustration of _your_ character," said she, endeavouring
to shake off her gravity	1.0000
--I will only say farther, that
     from what passed that evening, my opinion of all parties was
     confirmed, and every inducement heightened, which could have led me
     before, to preserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy
     connection	1.6875
"

"And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike
to him, without any reason	3.1618
Any other inconsistencies with modern spellings have
been left as printed	1.0000
"

To such perseverance in wilful self-deception Elizabeth would make no
reply, and immediately and in silence withdrew; determined, if he
persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering
encouragement, to apply to her father, whose negative might be uttered
in such a manner as must be decisive, and whose behaviour at least could
not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female	1.3895
Is this to be endured! But it must not, shall not be	1.0000
--"Oh! Mr	1.0000
Come as soon as you can on the receipt of
     this	14.1481
"Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year?"

"Not so much as I could wish, Sir; but I dare say he may spend half his
time here; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months	9.5462
I will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first
object	533.5212
Gardiner's business on her arrival, was to
distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions	1.0000
"And are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real
truth! Oh, that I knew how it was!"

But wishes were vain; or at best could serve only to amuse her in the
hurry and confusion of the following hour	1.0000
Bingley?"

"Not at all	1.0000
Darcy has no defect	1.0000
"

"In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of	5.1784
But we are none
of us consistent; and in his behaviour to me, there were stronger
impulses even than pride	9.9970
--The younger ones out before the elder are married!--Your
younger sisters must be very young?"

"Yes, my youngest is not sixteen	1.0000
Bingley," said her husband; "it is a person whom I
never saw in the whole course of my life	97.1648
To be
sure that _did_ seem as if he admired her--indeed I rather believe he
_did_--I heard something about it--but I hardly know what--something
about Mr	4.2166
She wished
to discredit it entirely, repeatedly exclaiming, "This must be false!
This cannot be! This must be the grossest falsehood!"--and when she had
gone through the whole letter, though scarcely knowing any thing of the
last page or two, put it hastily away, protesting that she would not
regard it, that she would never look in it again	5.1784
Bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter,
and impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss the
opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible; advice, which there
was every reason to believe would be attended to; and in the clamorous
happiness of Lydia herself in bidding farewell, the more gentle adieus
of her sisters were uttered without being heard	5.5458
"

"It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come since you will not
visit them	3.3593
She was ashamed to think how
much	99.9407
Denny comes back from town	1.0000
"

"My motive for cautioning you, is as follows	12.9112
It mortifies me	1.0000
Mr	1.0000
They were within twenty yards of each other, and so abrupt was his
appearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight	87.3267
In this quiet way, the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away	1.0000
But they are very pleasing women when you
converse with them	1.0000
"

"This is the consequence you see, Madam, of marrying a daughter," said
Elizabeth	3.8747
You are
not well enough;--you cannot go yourself	9.9970
I wish you had been there	715.8361
"

"Mr	1.0000
"Oh! my dear Lydia," she cried, "when shall we meet again?"

"Oh, lord! I don't know	1.1250
But at length, by Elizabeth's persuasion,
he was prevailed on to overlook the offence, and seek a reconciliation;
and, after a little farther resistance on the part of his aunt, her
resentment gave way, either to her affection for him, or her curiosity
to see how his wife conducted herself; and she condescended to wait on
them at Pemberley, in spite of that pollution which its woods had
received, not merely from the presence of such a mistress, but the
visits of her uncle and aunt from the city	5.0114
His father, Miss Bennet, the late Mr	26.8269
She talked on, therefore, without interruption from any of them till
they were joined by Mr	4.2169
Forster, and the probability of her being yet more
imprudent with such a companion at Brighton, where the temptations must
be greater than at home	6.3081
"

"You appear to me, Mr	1.0000
"

Elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied, "Yes, you know enough of
my _frankness_ to believe me capable of _that_	2.8480
He was most highly esteemed by Mr	1.0000
"There is a gentleman with him, mamma," said Kitty; "who can it be?"

"Some acquaintance or other, my dear, I suppose; I am sure I do not
know	37.9091
He added, that Mr	1.0000

"Oh! dear, yes;--but you must own she is very plain	1.1250

"Oh! no--it is not for _me_ to be driven away by Mr	0.6831

because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life	1.0000

Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade
in Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune and risen to the
honour of knighthood by an address to the King, during his mayoralty	4.0363
"

"There is, I believe, in every disposition a tendency to some particular
evil, a natural defect, which not even the best education can overcome	2.2758
"Good gracious! Lord bless me! only think! dear me! Mr	5.1318

Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below	17.7762
Bingley himself, Elizabeth withdrew
to Miss Lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last
partner she had scarcely replied, before Mr	2.6098
She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet's height, or
rather taller	1.0000
Let me take it
in the best light, in the light in which it may be understood	1.0000
Mrs	1.0000
"

And when her sisters abused it as ugly, she added, with perfect
unconcern, "Oh! but there were two or three much uglier in the shop; and
when I have bought some prettier-coloured satin to trim it with fresh, I
think it will be very tolerable	3.5938
His air was grave and
stately, and his manners were very formal	8.1091
Darcy himself; but,
whenever she did catch a glimpse, she saw an expression of general
complaisance, and in all that he said, she heard an accent so far
removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions, as convinced her that
the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed, however
temporary its existence might prove, had at least outlived one day	1.0000
At least, therefore, I did not assume the character of needless
precipitance merely to shew off before the ladies	37.9207
"And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother?" said Mr	9.9970
"

She burst into tears as she alluded to it, and for a few minutes could
not speak another word	127.3675
Her manners were
pronounced to be very bad indeed, a mixture of pride and impertinence;
she had no conversation, no style, no taste, no beauty	1.0000
No sentiment of shame gave a damp to her
triumph	1.0000
1	1.0000
"

"You may depend upon my not mentioning it	315.9933
This event had at last been despaired of, but it was then too
late to be saving	4.2170
Lady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeth's performance, mixing
with them many instructions on execution and taste	1.0000
"

"I _did_ hear, too, that there was a time, when sermon-making was not so
palatable to you as it seems to be at present; that you actually
declared your resolution of never taking orders, and that the business
had been compromised accordingly	7.0959
I knew you would be wishing me joy	1.0000
Our poor mother
     is sadly grieved	1.0000
--If, in the explanation of them which is
     due to myself, I am under the necessity of relating feelings which
     may be offensive to your's, I can only say that I am sorry	1.8956
He was too happy, however, to need much attention;
and luckily for the others, the business of love-making relieved them
from a great deal of his company	52.9668
I
     take up my pen again to do, what I have just told you I would not,
     but circumstances are such, that I cannot help earnestly begging
     you all to come here, as soon as possible	11.7814
Hurst or Miss Bingley; and even Lydia was too
much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of "Lord,
how tired I am!" accompanied by a violent yawn	2.3462
and Mrs	1.0000
No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you, can
think any thing wanting	1.0000
"

He then recollected her embarrassment a few days before, on his reading
Mr	5.8767
Bennet could hardly comprehend
it	2152.3049
&c	1.0000
On the contrary every particular relative
to his sister, was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself; and
if I endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct, who
will believe me? The general prejudice against Mr	17.7826
--On this subject I have nothing more
     to say, no other apology to offer	5.1784
Every thing, however, went on smoothly,
and was finally settled according to Charlotte's first sketch	1.0000
"

He then shut the door, and coming up to her, claimed the good wishes and
affection of a sister	3.1623

Miss Lucas was odious to her	1.0000
"

"Yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight	46.4150
"

"But she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow	5.1784
She was overpowered by shame and
vexation	1.0000
Elizabeth, who had expected to find in her as
acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever Mr	21.8084
--Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the
easiness, openness, ductility of his temper, though no disposition could
offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he never
appeared dissatisfied	6.8118
Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother	99.9407
"

Mrs	1.0000
At such a moment, the arrival of her friend
was a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth, though in the course of their
meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought, when she
saw Mr	32.1105
Gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing, he asked
her, if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends	5.5036
The latter was much more
agreeable than his companion expected	17.7762
Multiple
      superscripted characters are enclosed by curly brackets
      (example: M^{rs})	5.1784
The darling wish of his
sisters was then gratified; he bought an estate in a neighbouring county
to Derbyshire, and Jane and Elizabeth, in addition to every other source
of happiness, were within thirty miles of each other	3.1618
Had not my own feelings decided
against you, had they been indifferent, or had they even been
favourable, do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept
the man, who has been the means of ruining, perhaps for ever, the
happiness of a most beloved sister?"

As she pronounced these words, Mr	2.3462
Bennet withdrew to the library, she saw
Mr	26.8156
"

"You are over scrupulous surely	99.9977
Darcy is neither by
honour nor inclination confined to his cousin, why is not he to make
another choice? And if I am that choice, why may not I accept him?"

"Because honour, decorum, prudence, nay, interest, forbid it	3.3593
She
must own that she was tired of great houses; after going over so many,
she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains	2.4242

next day, and their aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr	26.4287

Absence had increased her desire of seeing
Charlotte again, and weakened her disgust of Mr	1.0000
But he had given a reason for his interference, which asked no
extraordinary stretch of belief	1.0000
"Your affectionate friend,

     "LYDIA BENNET	1.0000
"

"I have already told her so once, by your desire	8.1091
"




CHAPTER XVIII	1.0000
Darcy had to decide on the propriety of
his friend's inclination, or why, upon his own judgment alone, he was to
determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy	1.0000
--One does not know what to
think	2153.3290
Bennet, offended by his manner of mentioning a
country neighbourhood	12.9112
Forgive
me; and if you persist in indifference, do not make _me_ your
confidante	5.1795
"

"Are they indeed?" cried Elizabeth, with the greatest satisfaction	1.0000
There is nothing else to be done	99.9977
He leaves out half his words, and blots the rest	1.0000
She
could not bear such suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper,
wrote a short letter to her aunt, to request an explanation of what
Lydia had dropt, if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been
intended	8.9596
I have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment	345.2209
--His
     sisters' uneasiness had been equally excited with my own; our
     coincidence of feeling was soon discovered; and, alike sensible
     that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother, we shortly
     resolved on joining him directly in London	1.0000
Mrs	1.0000
Collins's scruples of leaving Mr	1.0000
--I
think it no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements	1.0000
The marriage of a daughter, which had been the first object of
her wishes, since Jane was sixteen, was now on the point of
accomplishment, and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those
attendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new carriages, and
servants	6.3088
Mrs	1.0000
In the dining-room they were soon joined by Mary and Kitty, who had been
too busily engaged in their separate apartments, to make their
appearance before	5.8773
Oh, brother,
how kind you are! I know you will contrive it all	1.0000
You need not	1.0000
But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness, is a most
natural consequence of the prejudices I had been encouraging	3.5932
I am not indebted for my present happiness to
your eager desire of expressing your gratitude	5.1795
Darcy might have done as well	315.9933
"

Elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those
in the room	1.0000
--Elizabeth could but just _affect_ concern in
missing him; she really rejoiced at it	1.0000
It would look odd to be
entirely silent for half an hour together, and yet for the advantage of
_some_, conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the
trouble of saying as little as possible	10.6065
"

Elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character, but said
nothing	6.8112
Wickham was as far beyond them all in person, countenance, air, and
walk, as _they_ were superior to the broad-faced stuffy uncle Philips,
breathing port wine, who followed them into the room	1.0000
Bingley before, expressed to her sister how very much
she admired him	1.0000
On distinguishing the ladies of the group,
the two gentlemen came directly towards them, and began the usual
civilities	37.9091
intending to trace their route	1.0000
"FITZWILLIAM DARCY	1.0000
Their taking her home, and affording her their personal
protection and countenance, is such a sacrifice to her advantage, as
years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge	1.0000
--They had several children	1.0000
I was very
uncomfortable, I may say unhappy	1.0000
Gardiner left them soon after breakfast	1.0000
"

Mr	1.0000
How much you
must have gone through!"

Her sister, however, assured her, of her being perfectly well; and their
conversation, which had been passing while Mr	1.0000
Darcy appeared again, when,
looking at him, she was a little relieved by his smile	4.2162
The whole family in short
were properly overjoyed on the occasion	1.0000
They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to
have their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little as
possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your
life	3.4711
Mrs	1.0000
She is on her road somewhere, I dare say, and so passing through
Meryton, thought she might as well call on you	2.8965
"

"I have not a doubt of Mr	719.0758
Collins has made
you an offer of marriage	2152.3049
He then sat down by her, and talked scarcely to any one else	8.9455
She was engaged one day as she walked, in re-perusing Jane's last
letter, and dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane had not
written in spirits, when, instead of being again surprised by Mr	3.3593
Collins well	1.0000
Bennet's sour looks and ill-natured remarks might have been
enough to drive happiness away	1.0000
You must and shall be married by a special licence	1.0000
No motive can
excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted _there_	1.0000
"

"Yes, vanity is a weakness indeed	26.8265
"

"It is evident by this," added Jane, "that he comes back no more this
winter	11.2883
Mr	1.0000
Lord!
how I should like to be married before any of you; and then I would
chaperon you about to all the balls	1.0000
But she had no reason to fear Mr	1.0000
It cannot last long	2154.3990
"Now," said she, "that this first meeting is over, I feel perfectly
easy	75.3427
You know not what you are
about	99.9407
I am afraid you will not be able to make
     it out, but I hardly know what I have written	187.6479
The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work	3.8740
You shewed me how insufficient were all my
pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased	1.0000
But who was your mother? Who
are your uncles and aunts? Do not imagine me ignorant of their
condition	1.0000
Bennet's visit, and sat about ten
minutes with him in his library	6.8112
"

He should be particularly happy at any time, &c	9.9970
"I admire all my three sons-in-law highly," said he	10.0000
They
ran through the vestibule into the breakfast room; from thence to the
library;--their father was in neither; and they were on the point of
seeking him up stairs with their mother, when they were met by the
butler, who said,

"If you are looking for my master, ma'am, he is walking towards the
little copse	4.1244
It was an
encouragement of vice; and had I been the rector of Longbourn, I should
very strenuously have opposed it	2.9936
Wickham, we are brother and sister, you know	17.7762
"

"I know you do; and it is _that_ which makes the wonder	5.8767
Miss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any
extenuating circumstances in the case, unknown to the society of
Hertfordshire; her mild and steady candour always pleaded for
allowances, and urged the possibility of mistakes--but by everybody else
Mr	1.6495
Kitty, run down and order the carriage	1.0000
Collins; and whatever might be his feelings towards her
friend, met her with every appearance of composure	3.8740
Bennet half opened the door and called out,

"Lizzy, my dear, I want to speak with you	37.9150
The
wish of procuring her regard, which she had assured herself of his
feeling in Derbyshire, could not in rational expectation survive such a
blow as this	2.3462
" She then sought her eldest sister, who had undertaken to make
inquiries on the same subject of Bingley	3.5932
Gardiner, though seldom able to indulge the
taste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much engaged in watching the
occasional appearance of some trout in the water, and talking to the man
about them, that he advanced but little	14.7411

Wickham	1.0000
At such an assembly as this, it
would be insupportable	166.7541
Bingley
was obliged to be in town the following day, and consequently unable to
accept the honour of their invitation, &c	2.8477
Darcy	1.0000
Not a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till their
visitor took his leave for the night; but as soon as he was gone, he
turned to his daughter and said,

"Jane, I congratulate you	23.0950
He
must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found
her	1.0000
So near
a vicinity to her mother and Meryton relations was not desirable even to
_his_ easy temper, or _her_ affectionate heart	2.9932
I believe him to be Lady Catherine's _nephew_	26.8156
Neither had any thing occurred in the intelligence of
their Lambton friends, that could materially lessen its weight	1.0000
Elizabeth felt Jane's
pleasure	1.0000
Collins should be in possession of the
Longbourn estate, it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife
should make their appearance at St	15.8451
CHAPTER III	1.0000
But
my dearest love, tell me what dish Mr	1.0000
"What can be the meaning of this!" said Charlotte, as soon as he was
gone	17.7825
She dreaded seeing Wickham again,
and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible	5.1784
They had often attempted it before, but it was a subject on which Mrs	34.5430
Darcy replied with great intrepidity,

"Miss Elizabeth Bennet	1.0000
They have
known her much longer than they have known me; no wonder if they love
her better	1.0000
Colonel Forster came yesterday, having left Brighton the day
     before, not many hours after the express	4.2170
"

They were all astonished; and Mr	1.0000
Hurst and Miss Bingley, they were noticed only by a curtsey; and
on their being seated, a pause, awkward as such pauses must always be,
succeeded for a few moments	8.1105
We _will_ know where
we have gone--we _will_ recollect what we have seen	5.8767
He only meant that there were not
such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town, which
you must acknowledge to be true	11.7839
"

"You persist, then, in supposing his sisters influence him	1.0000
I thought I should have died	1.0000
--Mr	1.0000
Mrs	1.0000
In every thing else she is as
good natured a girl as ever lived	1.0000
"

Miss Bennet still looked all amazement	99.9407
Will you be very angry with me, my dear
     Lizzy, if I take this opportunity of saying (what I was never bold
     enough to say before) how much I like him	4.2242
Mrs	1.0000
"

"We are speaking of music, Madam," said he, when no longer able to avoid
a reply	17.4493
Bennet could certainly
spare you for another fortnight	1.0000
Mr	1.0000
"

"Pride," observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of her
reflections, "is a very common failing I believe	2.6098
--Here you are in your own family	1.0000
Wickham	1.0000
It could not be for society, as he frequently sat there
ten minutes together without opening his lips; and when he did speak, it
seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice--a sacrifice to
propriety, not a pleasure to himself	1.0000
Mrs	1.0000
"

Elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal; yet
was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an
epithet	15.8433
Her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined	1.0000
He
then said,

"I have received a letter this morning that has astonished me
exceedingly	7.0351
"

"To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of
either	1.0000
"Well, Lizzy," continued her mother soon afterwards, "and so the
Collinses live very comfortable, do they? Well, well, I only hope it
will last	10.4508
Collins too!--Why should _he_ have it more than anybody else?"

"I leave it to yourself to determine," said Mr	1.0000
Bingley did
not do justice to his own disposition	719.0758
They will then join his regiment,
     unless they are first invited to Longbourn; and I understand from
     Mrs	1.0000
Hurst, "in running away
without telling us that you were coming out	1.0000
Nothing, on the contrary, could be more natural; and while able to
suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her, she was
ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both, and could very
sincerely wish him happy	1.6496
Darcy
returned within the stated time	1.0000
They had frequently been staying with her in town	1.0000
--Without thinking highly
either of men or of matrimony, marriage had always been her object; it
was the only honourable provision for well-educated young women of small
fortune, and however uncertain of giving happiness, must be their
pleasantest preservative from want	1.0000
--The
     necessity must be obeyed--and farther apology would be absurd	1.0000
It had better have happened to _you_, Lizzy; you
would have laughed yourself out of it sooner	1.0000
I am not ashamed of having been
mistaken--or, at least, it is slight, it is nothing in comparison of
what I should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters	7.6263
To Kitty, however, it does not
     seem so wholly unexpected	9.9970
Darcy only can answer	1.0000
They are not married,
     nor can I find there was any intention of being so; but if you are
     willing to perform the engagements which I have ventured to make on
     your side, I hope it will not be long before they are	8.1096
He may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my
acquaintance, but that is all	3.8740
With amazement did
she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power;
and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to
give, which a just sense of shame would not conceal	1.8328
You must
give me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the compliment of
believing what I say	12.9133
But little had she dared
to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there	1.0000
For a few moments, indeed,
she felt that he would probably strike into some other path	4.2170
"You certainly do," she replied with a smile; "but it does not follow
that the interruption must be unwelcome	23.0950
At our time of life, it is not so
pleasant I can tell you, to be making new acquaintance every day; but
for your sakes, we would do any thing	2.0535
Wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled, a
doubt of his being present had never occurred to her	1.0000
Had they fixed on any other man
it would have been nothing; but _his_ perfect indifference, and _your_
pointed dislike, make it so delightfully absurd! Much as I abominate
writing, I would not give up Mr	2.3462
They
entered it in one of its lowest points, and drove for some time through
a beautiful wood, stretching over a wide extent	1.0000
Sometimes she could fancy, that he talked less than on
former occasions, and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that
as he looked at her, he was trying to trace a resemblance	1.9307
They insist also on
     my seeing Mr	1.0000
"When is your next ball to be, Lizzy?"

"To-morrow fortnight	1.0000
"

In vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable, and Jane to make
her resigned	1.0000
Girls, can I do any
thing for you in Meryton? Oh! here comes Hill	1.0000
"I will go to Meryton," said she, "as soon as I am dressed, and tell the
good, good news to my sister Philips	12.1191
Collins's picture of Hunsford and
Rosings rationally softened; and Elizabeth perceived that she must wait
for her own visit there, to know the rest	1.0000
"

Elizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at Mr	166.7001
I now give it to _you_, if you are resolved on
having him	6.8112
"

"It is no such thing	99.9977
She talked to Elizabeth again and again;
coaxed and threatened her by turns	1.0000
Her favourite walk, and where
she frequently went while the others were calling on Lady Catherine, was
along the open grove which edged that side of the park, where there was
a nice sheltered path, which no one seemed to value but herself, and
where she felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherine's curiosity	7.2785
The business of her life was to get her
daughters married; its solace was visiting and news	4.2162
That had
his actions been what Wickham represented them, so gross a violation of
every thing right could hardly have been concealed from the world; and
that friendship between a person capable of it, and such an amiable man
as Mr	2.9934
This is the last time I shall ever
remember it myself	1.0000
He could even
listen to Sir William Lucas, when he complimented him on carrying away
the brightest jewel of the country, and expressed his hopes of their all
meeting frequently at St	4.2162
Darcy chose to doubt it--or to treat it as a merely
conditional recommendation, and to assert that I had forfeited all claim
to it by extravagance, imprudence, in short any thing or nothing	1.0000
--Not that I have much pleasure indeed in
talking to any body	1.0000
"It
seems likely to have been a desirable match for Jane," said she	138.8906
Her coming there was the most unfortunate, the most ill-judged
thing in the world! How strange must it appear to him! In what a
disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man! It might seem as if
she had purposely thrown herself in his way again! Oh! why did she come?
or, why did he thus come a day before he was expected? Had they been
only ten minutes sooner, they should have been beyond the reach of his
discrimination, for it was plain that he was that moment arrived, that
moment alighted from his horse or his carriage	5.1795
[Illustration: A VICARAGE HOUSE	316.2188
It is very unlucky; but as I have actually paid the visit, we
cannot escape the acquaintance now	1.0000
"About a month ago I received this letter, and about a fortnight ago I
answered it, for I thought it a case of some delicacy, and requiring
early attention	4.4165
Collins was at leisure to look around him and admire, and he was so much
struck with the size and furniture of the apartment, that he declared he
might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour
at Rosings; a comparison that did not at first convey much
gratification; but when Mrs	3.4331
Had his own happiness, however, been
the only sacrifice, he might have been allowed to sport with it in what
ever manner he thought best; but her sister's was involved in it, as she
thought he must be sensible himself	8.7355

By supposing such an
affection, you make every body acting unnaturally and wrong, and me most
unhappy	1.0000
What he told me was merely this; that he congratulated himself
on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most
imprudent marriage, but without mentioning names or any other
particulars, and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing him
the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort, and from
knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer	1.3768
"

Miss Bingley's congratulations to her brother, on his approaching
marriage, were all that was affectionate and insincere	11.2849
Mr	1.0000
You are all to come to Pemberley at Christmas	1.0000
Her air
was not conciliating, nor was her manner of receiving them, such as to

Gardiner; and after relating the
circumstances, she thus went on:--"I am now convinced, my dear aunt,
that I have never been much in love; for had I really experienced that
pure and elevating passion, I should at present detest his very name,
and wish him all manner of evil	4.8934

"You must not be too severe upon yourself," replied Elizabeth	6.8129

Collins,
and Mr	99997.5165
With the Gardiners, they were always on the most intimate terms	9.9970
She turned from sister to sister, demanding their
congratulations, and when at length they all sat down, looked eagerly
round the room, took notice of some little alteration in it, and
observed, with a laugh, that it was a great while since she had been
there	6.8759

Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his
successful love; for Mrs	5.1784
Her thoughts were all fixed on that
one spot of Pemberley House, whichever it might be, where Mr	3.5932

"Certainly," replied Elizabeth--"there are such people, but I hope I am
not one of _them_	36.6217

"His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same," said
Elizabeth angrily; "for I have heard you accuse him of nothing worse
than of being the son of Mr	6.4681

"Miss Elizabeth Bennet!" repeated Miss Bingley	1.0000
This preservative she had now
obtained; and at the age of twenty-seven, without having ever been
handsome, she felt all the good luck of it	5.8773
--Elizabeth accepted their company, and the three young ladies set
off together	6.8112
He
found her as handsome as she had been last year; as good natured, and as
unaffected, though not quite so chatty	2.7210
In revolving lady Catherine's expressions, however, she could not help
feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting
in this interference	11.5387
Philips
protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery
tickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards	2.9932
"There has
been many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way	1.0000
She would not betray her trust, I suppose, without bribery
     and corruption, for she really did know where her friend was to be
     found	6.3088
After this period, every

the house	6.8112

"Mama," cried Lydia, "my aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain
Carter do not go so often to Miss Watson's as they did when they first
came; she sees them now very often standing in Clarke's library	1.0000
Darcy, whose
reception of his advances she eagerly watched, and whose astonishment at
being so addressed was very evident	3.3593

their other neighbours, and to hear herself called "Mrs	17.7762
People _did_ say,
you meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas; but, however, I hope
it is not true	8.1102
--Wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of
     my youth, the acknowledged favourite of my father, a young man who
     had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage, and who
     had been brought up to expect its exertion, would be a depravity,
     to which the separation of two young persons, whose affection could
     be the growth of only a few weeks, could bear no comparison	4.7383
If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy	3.8746
Between Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept them
mutually silent on the subject; and Elizabeth felt persuaded that no
real confidence could ever subsist between them again	2.2122
"Lizzy is
only headstrong in such matters as these	17.7762
Mrs	1.0000
and
Mrs	1.0000
Your uncle is as much surprised as I am--and nothing
     but the belief of your being a party concerned, would have allowed
     him to act as he has done	2.1542
As she went up stairs to get ready, Mrs	17.7762
On both sides it was only assertion	1.0000
Darcy can please where he chuses	1.0000
Lady Catherine herself says
that in point of true beauty, Miss De Bourgh is far superior to the
handsomest of her sex; because there is that in her features which marks
the young woman of distinguished birth	1.0000
"

Elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference for
her authority proceeded; but it was not in her power to give any
information of so satisfactory a nature, as the compliment deserved	7.4609
Mr	1.0000

     it was by good luck, for I am sure she did not listen	15.0130

She had been watching him the last hour,
she said, as he walked up and down the street, and had Mr	23.1010
The pause was to Elizabeth's feelings
dreadful	1.0000
The world has been deceived in that respect; and I am happy to
     say, there will be some little money, even when all his debts are
     discharged, to settle on my niece, in addition to her own fortune	29.0595
Bennet could not have chosen
better	1.0000
"

"And if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he has at least
great pleasure in the power of choice	2.8477
Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of
Mr	12.9112
Well, he certainly is
very agreeable, and I give you leave to like him	5.1784
"And they are really to be married!" cried Elizabeth, as soon as they
were by themselves	17.7762
They went to the library,
therefore, and asked their father, whether he would not wish them to
make it known to her	20.1456
"

"Go, my dear," cried her mother, "and shew her ladyship about the
different walks	19.9918
She has been doing
every thing in her power by thinking and talking on the subject, to give
greater--what shall I call it? susceptibility to her feelings; which are
naturally lively enough	6.3088
"

Elizabeth did not know what to make of it	316.1060
Mr	1.0000
Seriously, I would have you be on your guard	1.0000
Here are officers enough at
Meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country	5.8767
But
this idea was soon banished, and her spirits were very differently
affected, when, to her utter amazement, she saw Mr	2.7210
Not one party, or scheme, or any thing	17.7762
"

"But does Lydia know nothing of this? Can she be ignorant of what you
and Jane seem so well to understand?"

"Oh, yes!--that, that is the worst of all	1.0000
That she should receive an offer of
marriage from Mr	17.7762
--The last born has as good a right to the pleasures of
youth, as the first	1.0000
My reproofs at Hunsford could not
work such a change as this	1.0000
After breakfast, the girls walked to Meryton to inquire if Mr	1.0000
"He is just what a young man ought to be," said she, "sensible, good
humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners!--so much ease,
with such perfect good breeding!"

"He is also handsome," replied Elizabeth, "which a young man ought
likewise to be, if he possibly can	9.1281
I was not in a humour to
wait for any opening of your's	1.0000
"--And
upon Elizabeth's seeming really, with vexed and embarrassed looks, about
to escape, she added, "Lizzy, I _insist_ upon your staying and hearing
Mr	5.0401
That it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side, too, was
another very welcome surprise; for his chief wish at present, was to
have as little trouble in the business as possible	1.8632
9	1.0000
Bennet, to whom they then turned, was not quite
so cordial	533.2382
Bennet and Lydia are going in the carriage to
Meryton	1.0000
The gentlemen arrived early; and, before Mrs	1.0000
His behaviour to her sister was such, during dinner time, as shewed an
admiration of her, which, though more guarded than formerly, persuaded
Elizabeth, that if left wholly to himself, Jane's happiness, and his
own, would be speedily secured	4.3473
Bennet sat looking and winking at
Elizabeth and Catherine for a considerable time, without making any
impression on them	1.0000
Bennet, in short, was in very great spirits; she had seen enough of
Bingley's behaviour to Jane, to be convinced that she would get him at
last; and her expectations of advantage to her family, when in a happy
humour, were so far beyond reason, that she was quite disappointed at
not seeing him there again the next day, to make his proposals	5.0606
and Mrs	1.0000
They were off Saturday night about twelve, as
     is conjectured, but were not missed till yesterday morning at
     eight	1.0000
It is, in short, impossible for us to
conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them,
without actual blame on either side	2.5119

With astonishment did Elizabeth see, that her new
acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself	1.0000
There was too much to
be thought; and felt, and said, for attention to any other objects	3.5938
Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of
passing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and was too
much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas
was his neighbour, till Sir William thus began	1.0000
"I have been thinking it over again, Elizabeth," said her uncle, as they
drove from the town; "and really, upon serious consideration, I am much
more inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does of the
matter	13.9956
F	1.0000
But his anger, I am persuaded, lasted no longer than he remained
in any doubt of your sister's sentiments	9.9985

opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind	1.0000

Elizabeth, for the sake of
saying something that might turn her mother's thoughts, now asked her if
Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since _her_ coming away	5.1789
The Lucases are very artful people indeed,
sister	1.0000
Bingley, and the
train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to,
made her perhaps almost as happy as Jane	2.9936
You need not send them word at
     Longbourn of my going, if you do not like it, for it will make the
     surprise the greater, when I write to them, and sign my name Lydia

Gardiner, "there is no absolute proof
that they are not gone to Scotland	203.0419

"You are very cruel," said her sister, "you will not let me smile, and
are provoking me to it every moment	83.7479

"Well, then, you need not be under any alarm	10.9173

Lydia were far from envying Miss Lucas, for Mr	9.9970

The coach, therefore, took them the first stage of their
journey, and brought its master back to Longbourn	11.2849
In the first place, she persisted in disbelieving
the whole of the matter; secondly, she was very sure that Mr	26.8230
She does not yet leave her dressing-room	1.0000
He was growing quite
inattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by her	1.0000
And yet, upon my honour, I
believed what I said of myself to be true, and I believe it at this
moment	20.1481
Collins
received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure, and then
proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview, with the result
of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied, since the
refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow
from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character	1.4873
The feelings
of the person who wrote, and the person who received it, are now so
widely different from what they were then, that every unpleasant
circumstance attending it, ought to be forgotten	1.9305
Not these two or three years perhaps	1.0000
Now be sincere;
did you admire me for my impertinence?"

"For the liveliness of your mind, I did	1.0000
She could neither
wonder nor condemn, but the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing
consolatory to her bosom, afforded no palliation of her distress	1.0000
Miss Bingley's civility to Elizabeth increased at last
very rapidly, as well as her affection for Jane; and when they parted,
after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to
see her either at Longbourn or Netherfield, and embracing her most
tenderly, she even shook hands with the former	2.5235
When convinced on that article, Miss Bennet had nothing
farther to wish	1.0000
His character was decided	99851.7530
The park was very large, and contained great variety of ground	1.0000
are
sufficiently known	1.0000
She accounted for it, however, by supposing that
her last letter to her friend from Longbourn, had by some accident been
lost	7.4047
"

"Your list of the common extent of accomplishments," said Darcy, "has
too much truth	3.5991
A small sum could not do all this	46.3929
Hope was over, entirely over; and when Jane could attend to the rest of
the letter, she found little, except the professed affection of the
writer, that could give her any comfort	15.2522
But I believe your opinion of him would in general
astonish--and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly
anywhere else	8.1091
Bingley was the principal spokesman, and Miss Bennet the
principal object	9.9999
And their
mother had the satisfaction of knowing, that she should be able to shew
her married daughter in the neighbourhood, before she was banished to
the North	11.7864
I shall never be quite happy till I
     have been all round the park	46.3929
"

"You did! and it was not wholly without foundation	1.0000
But Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every prospect
of her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not dwell long on her
spirits; and having told all her griefs to Charlotte Lucas, whom she had
not seen for a week, she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to
the oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her particular
notice	3.5932
Bingley called again, and alone	1.0000
Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners were very much admired at the parsonage,
and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of
their engagements at Rosings	5.1784
Lakes, mountains,
and rivers, shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations; nor, when
we attempt to describe any particular scene, will we begin quarrelling
about its relative situation	1.0000
You have delighted us long enough	1.0000
"

He then told her of Georgiana's delight in her acquaintance, and of her
disappointment at its sudden interruption; which naturally leading to
the cause of that interruption, she soon learnt that his resolution of
following her from Derbyshire in quest of her sister, had been formed
before he quitted the inn, and that his gravity and thoughtfulness
there, had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must
comprehend	2.4524
I was uncomfortable enough	1.0000
She asked her at different times, how many sisters
she had, whether they were older or younger than herself, whether any of
them were likely to be married, whether they were handsome, where they
had been educated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been her
mother's maiden name?--Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her
questions, but answered them very composedly	1.3768
"Of music! Then pray speak aloud	1.0000
But it ought to
be done, and if you will give me a sheet of paper, it shall be done
directly	8.9602
"

"That is very true," replied Elizabeth, "and I could easily forgive
_his_ pride, if he had not mortified _mine_	136.6584
Egerton,
Military Library, Whitehall	316.2188
There--I have saved you the trouble of accounting for it;
and really, all things considered, I begin to think it perfectly
reasonable	1.0000
They crossed it by a simple bridge, in character with the general air of
the scene; it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited; and
the valley, here contracted into a glen, allowed room only for the
stream, and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered
it	1.4977
I hope I never ridicule what is wise or good	1.0000
"

Elizabeth's spirits were so high on the occasion, that though she did
not often speak unnecessarily to Mr	37.9205
Gardiner could do	1.0000
Darcy took up a book; Miss Bingley did the same;
and Mrs	1.0000
It amazes
me, I confess;--for certainly, there can be nothing so advantageous to
them as instruction	3.3593
Amongst the most violent against him was Mrs	1.0000
Collins to join his daughters in their
walk; and Mr	1.0000
To Jane, he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused, and
whose merit she had undervalued; but to her own more extensive
information, he was the person, to whom the whole family were indebted
for the first of benefits, and whom she regarded herself with an
interest, if not quite so tender, at least as reasonable and just, as
what Jane felt for Bingley	1.8631
Darcy
had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance	1.0000
--But I tell you what, Miss Lizzy, if you take
it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way,
you will never get a husband at all--and I am sure I do not know who is
to maintain you when your father is dead	16.7297
Her affections had been continually
fluctuating, but never without an object	1.0000

Hurst sang with her sister, and while they were thus employed
Elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some music books
that lay on the instrument, how frequently Mr	9.2841
He promises fairly, and I hope among different people,
     where they may each have a character to preserve, they will both be
     more prudent	2.5119

"

At that moment they were met from another walk, by Mrs	1.0000
Darcy's next step was
     to make your uncle acquainted with it, and he first called in
     Gracechurch-street the evening before I came home	2.7213

It is not the object of this work to give a description of Derbyshire,
nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither
lay; Oxford, Blenheim, Warwick, Kenelworth, Birmingham, &c	1.8047
But the gloom of Lydia's prospect was shortly cleared away; for she
received an invitation from Mrs	1.0000
Darcy corroborated it with a bow, and
was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on Elizabeth, when they
were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger, and Elizabeth
happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other,
was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting	5.3364
--But their
father, though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure, was really
glad to see them; he had felt their importance in the family circle	2.2756
Darcy rise also and follow him, and her agitation on seeing it was
extreme	1.0000
The
liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value!"

She was now, on being settled at home, at leisure to observe the real
state of her sister's spirits	1.0000
It was, moreover, such a promising thing for her younger
daughters, as Jane's marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of
other rich men; and lastly, it was so pleasant at her time of life to be
able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister, that
she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked	7.1956
"

"I must not decide on my own performance	1.0000
You supposed more than
     really existed	1.0000
4	1.0000
As to
his real character, had information been in her power, she had never
felt a wish of enquiring	11.2865
Every day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety; but the most anxious
part of each was when the post was expected	1.0000
The old lady is Mrs	1.0000
"

"We will be down as soon as we can," said Jane; "but I dare say Kitty is
forwarder than either of us, for she went up stairs half an hour ago	3.5938
I wish I could see her	316.2238
She had not at first thought very seriously of
going thither; but Charlotte, she soon found, was depending on the plan,
and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure
as well as greater certainty	1.8047
She felt anew the justice of Mr	1.0000
"It must not be thought of	99.9995
"

"Is my father in town?"

"Yes, he went on Tuesday as I wrote you word	1.0000
Darcy's character, though he had assured her that respect for the
father, would always prevent his exposing the son	3.1618
Mr	1.0000
They agreed that Mrs	1.0000
Collins listened to her
with the determined air of following his own inclination, and when she
ceased speaking, replied thus,

"My dear Miss Elizabeth, I have the highest opinion in the world of your
excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your
understanding, but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference
between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity, and those
which regulate the clergy; for give me leave to observe that I consider
the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank
in the kingdom--provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the
same time maintained	4.0775
"

Mr	1.0000
I shall offer to pay him to-morrow; he will rant and storm about
his love for you, and there will be an end of the matter	2.4242
She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings,
and had sent for him only the Saturday before, to make up her pool of
quadrille in the evening	4.8934
At night she opened her heart to Jane	1.0000
"

"Neither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude," replied Elizabeth, "have any
possible claim on me, in the present instance	6.8934
"I have an excessive regard for Jane Bennet, she is really a very sweet
girl, and I wish with all my heart she were well settled	5.5048
I
hope he will overlook it	315.9933
Good Heaven! Brighton, and a whole
campful of soldiers, to us, who have been overset already by one poor
regiment of militia, and the monthly balls of Meryton	1.0000
They
had nothing to accuse him of but pride; pride he probably had, and if
not, it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small
market-town, where the family did not visit	1.8956
1	1.0000
Does she live near you, sir?"

"The garden in which stands my humble abode, is separated only by a lane
from Rosings Park, her ladyship's residence	1.0000
'Lady
Catherine,' said she, 'you have given me a treasure	1.0000
As soon as they were gone, Elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits;
or in other words, to dwell without interruption on those subjects that
must deaden them more	31.0820
Such were the gentle murmurs of Mrs	99.9407
Mrs	1.0000
It is very often nothing but
our own vanity that deceives us	1.0000
James's, Sir William was so completely
awed, by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had but just courage
enough to make a very low bow, and take his seat without saying a word;
and his daughter, frightened almost out of her senses, sat on the edge
of her chair, not knowing which way to look	6.4031
"

"How can you contrive to write so even?"

He was silent	1.0000
However, your coming just at this time is the
greatest of comforts, and I am very glad to hear what you tell us, of
long sleeves	14.5756
She began at length to recover, to
fidget about in her chair, get up, sit down again, wonder, and bless
herself	1.0000
"

"_That_ is a failing indeed!"--cried Elizabeth	1.0000
Their society can afford no pleasure,
that will atone for such wretchedness as this! Let me never see either
one or the other again!"

Yet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer no
compensation, received soon afterwards material relief, from observing
how much the beauty of her sister re-kindled the admiration of her
former lover	1.0000
He
smiled, looked handsome, and said many pretty things	12.9112

     events, Mr	1.0000
PRIDE & PREJUDICE	1.0000
Gardiner was so little to be trusted	1.0000
I told him of
all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs,
absurd and impertinent	15.4841
"And then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my sisters
behind you; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before the
winter is over	16.2960
You
may have drawn him in	1.0000
She was quite amazed
at her own discomposure; but amongst other causes of disquiet, she
dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in
her favour; and more than commonly anxious to please, she naturally
suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her	1.0000
"

"If you mean Darcy," cried her brother, "he may go to bed, if he chuses,
before it begins--but as for the ball, it is quite a settled thing; and
as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough I shall send round my
cards	6.1778
"

Elizabeth looked at Darcy to see how cordially he assented to his
cousin's praise; but neither at that moment nor at any other could she
discern any symptom of love; and from the whole of his behaviour to Miss
De Bourgh she derived this comfort for Miss Bingley, that he might have
been just as likely to marry _her_, had she been his relation	5.4355
I promised
them so faithfully! What will Wickham say? It was to be such a secret!"

"If it was to be secret," said Jane, "say not another word on the
subject	1.0000
But let me advise you to think better of it	1.0000
Darcy was really the
object of her choice, by explaining the gradual change which her
estimation of him had undergone, relating her absolute certainty that
his affection was not the work of a day, but had stood the test of many
months suspense, and enumerating with energy all his good qualities, she
did conquer her father's incredulity, and reconcile him to the match	1.9682
"

"Oh! where, where is my uncle?" cried Elizabeth, darting from her seat
as she finished the letter, in eagerness to follow him, without losing a
moment of the time so precious; but as she reached the door, it was
opened by a servant, and Mr	0.6831
E	1.0000
"Yes, she called yesterday with her father	46.9075
She felt it so; and though, in
looking forward, neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity,
could be justly expected for her sister; in looking back to what they
had feared, only two hours ago, she felt all the advantages of what they
had gained	10.4786
"

Mr	1.0000
"

Elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt persuaded
of her sister's ready acquiescence	4.2169
She cared for none
     of her friends, she wanted no help of his, she would not hear of
     leaving Wickham	31.6132
"

"Kitty has no discretion in her coughs," said her father; "she times
them ill	4.0283
Bennet's eyes sparkled with pleasure, and she was
eagerly calling out, while her daughter read,

"Well, Jane, who is it from? what is it about? what does he say? Well,
Jane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love	5.5042

established as a sweet girl, and their brother felt authorised by such
commendation to think of her as he chose	1.0000

No
     arguments shall be wanting on my part, that can alleviate so severe
     a misfortune; or that may comfort you, under a circumstance that
     must be of all others most afflicting to a parent's mind	3.4711

Collins by Jane's introduction of him	1.0000
Your sisters are engaged, and there is not
another woman in the room, whom it would not be a punishment to me to
stand up with	14.2477
He had been some days in town, before he was able to
     discover them; but he had something to direct his search, which was
     more than _we_ had; and the consciousness of this, was another
     reason for his resolving to follow us	7.7406
"With my mother up stairs	1.0000
"

"We will go as far as Meryton with you," said Catherine and
Lydia	4.6416
Gardiner were half a quarter of a
mile behind	1.0000
A great deal more passed at the
other table	26.8156
Bingley's large fortune, the mention of which gave animation to their
mother, was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of
an ensign	2.4242
"

"Upon my word, Sir," cried Elizabeth, "your hope is rather an
extraordinary one after my declaration	83.1504
The
happiness which this reply produced, was such as he had probably never
felt before; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as
warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do	1.8328
Darcy, only for a few minutes to take
leave, but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least
an hour, hoping for her return, and almost resolving to walk after her
till she could be found	3.1623
"

It was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now	719.3691
You have sense, and we all
expect you to use it	1.0000
Let us hope, therefore, that her being
there may teach her her own insignificance	26.8156
Bingley and Jane were standing together, a little detached from the
rest, and talked only to each other	3.5938
Wickham was to
     the last so steady, that in his will he particularly recommended it
     to me, to promote his advancement in the best manner that his
     profession might allow, and if he took orders, desired that a
     valuable family living might be his as soon as soon as it became
     vacant	2.3461
The supposition did not pain her	1.0000
Darcy with grave propriety requested to be allowed the honour of her
hand; but in vain	1.0000
Darcy's letter, nor explain to her sister how sincerely she
had been valued by his friend	4.2162
"

"Is this a hint to me, Lizzy," said her father, "to send for the
horses?"

"No, indeed	3.3508
My aunt told me so
herself on Saturday	1.0000
They were confined for the evening at different tables, and she had
nothing to hope, but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side
of the room, as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself	10.6073
Lady Catherine rose also, and they turned
back	1.0000
Thoughtlessness,
want of attention to other people's feelings, and want of resolution,
will do the business	3.5932
--I did not believe her to be
     indifferent because I wished it;--I believed it on impartial
     conviction, as truly as I wished it in reason	2.2756

"And do you like her?"

"Very much	42.7880
Mr	1.0000

"We are not in a way to know _what_ Mr	1.0000
She coloured as she spoke; but neither that, nor any thing
else, awakened a suspicion of the truth	3.3593

"Good gracious!" cried Mrs	17.5789
"

"Oh!--Your uncle!--He keeps a man-servant, does he?--I am very glad you
have somebody who thinks of those things	5.8207
Will you come and see me?"

"We shall often meet, I hope, in Hertfordshire	1.0000
"

"I beg your pardon," replied Miss Bingley, turning away with a sneer	6.0971
Mr	1.0000
Miss Darcy looked as if she
wished for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes did venture a
short sentence, when there was least danger of its being heard	2.1542
"

Mrs	1.0000
Mrs	1.0000
While the contents of the first
letter remained on her mind, she was all surprise--all astonishment that
Wickham should marry a girl, whom it was impossible he could marry for
money; and how Lydia could ever have attached him, had appeared
incomprehensible	2.7210
A military life is not what I was intended for, but circumstances have
now made it eligible	1.0000
Is not it so, Mrs	1.0000
His behaviour to us has,
     in every respect, been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire	15.0079
Bingley and his sisters came to give their
personal invitation for the long expected ball at Netherfield, which was
fixed for the following Tuesday	7.4056
When I last saw her, she was not very promising	166.7530
Having now a good house and very sufficient income, he intended to
marry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn family he had
a wife in view, as he meant to chuse one of the daughters, if he found
them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report	1.5317
Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject; and
affectionately taking her hand, said in reply,

"Do not make yourself uneasy, my love	11.7851
It is a pity they are not handsome! Not that _I_ think
Charlotte so _very_ plain--but then she is our particular friend	47.5146
"

"You have only proved by this," cried Elizabeth, "that Mr	146.3903
She was
sorry that Mr	1.0000
"Well, mamma," said she, when they were all returned to the breakfast
room, "and what do you think of my husband? Is not he a charming man? I
am sure my sisters must all envy me	105.4128
Collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had passed	9.9970
He repeated the question, with some
surprise at her silence	1.0000
--Many
stared	1.0000
" She then sat still five
minutes longer; but unable to waste such a precious occasion, she
suddenly got up, and saying to Kitty,

"Come here, my love, I want to speak to you," took her out of the room	7.0959
Jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the
society of her two friends, and the attentions of their brother; and
Elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr	2.0533
Not like the wild young men now-a-days, who think of nothing but
themselves	6.8112
The justice of the charge struck her too forcibly
for denial, and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded, as
having passed at the Netherfield ball, and as confirming all his first
disapprobation, could not have made a stronger impression on his mind
than on hers	2.6098
9	1.0000
The next was in these words	1.0000
Jane resolutely
kept her place at the table; but Elizabeth, to satisfy her mother, went
to the window--she looked,--she saw Mr	2.3460

No one made any reply	1.0000

Miss Bingley offered her the carriage, and she only
wanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane testified such concern
in parting with her, that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer
of the chaise into an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the
present	11.0042
Wickham has created, a
     suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his
     real character	1.0000
Ignorant as you previously were of every thing
     concerning either, detection could not be in your power, and
     suspicion certainly not in your inclination	2.6098
It was consequently necessary to
name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity; to have
some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed, and by
again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation, console herself for the
present, and prepare for another disappointment	4.0942
With such rivals for the notice of the fair, as Mr	1.0000
Nobody can tell what I
suffer!--But it is always so	1.0000
"Oh! Lizzy, why am I thus singled from my family, and blessed
above them all! If I could but see _you_ as happy! If there _were_ but
such another man for you!"

"If you were to give me forty such men, I never could be so happy as
you	1.1250
Collins and myself on
this happy event, let me now add a short hint on the subject of another:
of which we have been advertised by the same authority	4.8934
Her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in
her way	1.0000
"

With such kind of histories of their parties and good jokes, did Lydia,
assisted by Kitty's hints and additions, endeavour to amuse her
companions all the way to Longbourn	1.0000
"

"And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry? Did he know of
their intending to go off? Had Colonel Forster seen Denny himself?"

"Yes; but when questioned by _him_ Denny denied knowing any thing of
their plan, and would not give his real opinion about it	1.0000
"He must be an oddity, I think," said she	65.7756
She is quite a little
creature	1.0000
He was struggling for the
appearance of composure, and would not open his lips, till he believed
himself to have attained it	8.1091
He is nothing to us, you know, and I am sure
_I_ never want to see him again	718.5872
"And _that_ I suppose is one of your sisters	315.9933
I was ready to die of laughter	1.0000
It was reasonable, however, to
hope, that they would not continue long	1192.9545
Darcy, and Lizzy, and Kitty," said Mrs	166.7541
Of Mr	1.0000
Collins made his
declaration in form	1.0000
Whatever bears affinity to cunning is
despicable	1.0000
My daughter and my
nephew are formed for each other	1.0000
While settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound of the
door bell, and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its
being Colonel Fitzwilliam himself, who had once before called late in
the evening, and might now come to enquire particularly after her	3.8742
I have been a disappointed man, and
my spirits will not bear solitude	8.9455
"




CHAPTER VI	1.0000
Ring the bell,
Kitty, for Hill	1.0000
Our
importance, our respectability in the world, must be affected by the
wild volatility, the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark
Lydia's character	5.5042
"

She then ran gaily off, rejoicing as she rambled about, in the hope of
being at home again in a day or two	6.8129
Darcy, that they scarcely ever saw him	46.4150
I shall send for my
     clothes when I get to Longbourn; but I wish you would tell Sally
     to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown, before they are
     packed up	2.0091
I know you will do him such ample justice, that I am
growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent	3.5938
"

Mr	1.0000
As for Wickham and Lydia, their characters suffered no revolution from
the marriage of her sisters	4.6407
Mr	1.0000
He took the hint,
and when Mary had finished her second song, said aloud,

"That will do extremely well, child	2.7213
"

"Mr	1.0000
I thought I should have broke my heart	1.0000
Did you see him while you were at Lambton? I thought I
understood from the Gardiners that you had	1.0000
Darcy could be so unworthy of Mr	1.0000
E	1.0000
She continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of Lady
Catherine's carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter
Charlotte's observation, and hurried her away to her room	2.0535
Bingley with having promised on his first coming
into the country to give a ball at Netherfield	4.6407
Kitty is slight and delicate, and Mary studies so much, that her hours
of repose should not be broken in on	2.9932
When all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen,
they returned down stairs, and taking leave of the housekeeper, were
consigned over to the gardener, who met them at the hall door	1.8046
Bingley, she had likewise seen for an instant, and in that short period
saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed	3.1618
If you should have no objection to receive me
     into your house, I propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on
     you and your family, Monday, November 18th, by four o'clock, and
     shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the Saturday
     se'night following, which I can do without any inconvenience, as
     Lady Catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a
     Sunday, provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the
     duty of the day	4.0025
The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no
otherwise than by netting a purse, or covering a skreen	1.0000
"I would not on any
account trifle with her affectionate solicitude; or allow her to hear it
from any one but myself	9.7678
I have a warm, unguarded temper, and I
may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion _of_ him, and _to_ him, too
freely	1.0000
But I hope you will not mind it: it is
all for Jane's sake, you know; and there is no occasion for talking to
him, except just now and then	9.8879
Poor
Jane! I am sorry for her, because, with her disposition, she may not get
over it immediately	1.0000
That tall, proud man	1.0000
Reflection must be
reserved for solitary hours; whenever she was alone, she gave way to it
as the greatest relief; and not a day went by without a solitary walk,
in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant
recollections	2.8477
When first
he entered the corps, she was ready enough to admire him; but so we all
were	3.5932
She had dressed with more than
usual care, and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all
that remained unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it was not more than
might be won in the course of the evening	3.5857

other--about eight years ago	5.8780

their father and mother	21.5399

"This account then is what he has received from Mr	1.0000
Its business office is located at 809
North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887	3.1618
"

"Your surprise could not be greater than _mine_ in being noticed by you	1.0000
--That they might have met without ill consequence, is
     perhaps probable;--but his regard did not appear to me enough
     extinguished for him to see her without some danger	2.1015
Collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary	1.0000
Darcy	1.0000
F	1.0000
"

"But if he returns no more this winter, my choice will never be
required	4.6407
--But to be guarded at such a time, is
very difficult	10.9201
But the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man, whom
they had never seen before, of most gentleman-like appearance, walking
with an officer on the other side of the way	13.8914
Mrs	1.0000
"

"My object _then_," replied Darcy, "was to shew you, by every civility
in my power, that I was not so mean as to resent the past; and I hoped
to obtain your forgiveness, to lessen your ill opinion, by letting you
see that your reproofs had been attended to	2.3701
When the first
transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were
over, he naturally returned to all his former indolence	2.7210
Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving any
one; and all that I can hope in this case is, that she is deceived
herself	7.4038
From his garden, Mr	1.0000
Nothing could
console and nothing appease her	1.0000
He still loves me, and we are
engaged	1.0000
If you and Miss
Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room, I shall be very
thankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me	24.6159
Robinson's asking him how he liked our Meryton
assemblies, and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty
women in the room, and _which_ he thought the prettiest? and his
answering immediately to the last question--Oh! the eldest Miss Bennet
beyond a doubt, there cannot be two opinions on that point	4.0366
"I have no reason, I assure you," said he, "to be dissatisfied with my
reception	26401.5212
Such relief, however, as it was in her power to afford, by the practice
of what might be called economy in her own private expences, she
frequently sent them	9.2832
Well, if they can be easy with an
estate that is not lawfully their own, so much the better	1.0000
"They
will join me early to-morrow," he continued, "and among them are some
who will claim an acquaintance with you,--Mr	14.2477
The others then joined her, and expressed their admiration of his
figure; but Elizabeth heard not a word, and, wholly engrossed by her own
feelings, followed them in silence	8.6572
That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over a
ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the assembly
brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate	1.0000
Bennet's invention was again at work to get
every body away from him and her daughter	1.0000
What I have to say relates to
     poor Lydia	1.0000
It was next to impossible that their cousin should
come in a scarlet coat, and it was now some weeks since they had
received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour	1.9684
The distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly	1.0000
"If they had uncles enough to fill _all_ Cheapside," cried Bingley, "it
would not make them one jot less agreeable	2.8202

at Mr	1.0000
--What advantage can it be to you
to offend Mr	1.0000
Mr	1.0000
Miss Darcy's praise occupied
the chief of it	1.0000
"

"Oh!--you mean Jane, I suppose--because he danced with her twice	17.7827
"

"Yes, indeed," cried Mrs	1147.8536
Darcy's
sometimes coming there stopped her, and instead of entering the park,
she turned up the lane, which led her farther from the turnpike road	2.4242
Lady Catherine will not think the worse of you for
being simply dressed	1.0000
Wickham is the son of a very
     respectable man, who had for many years the management of all the
     Pemberley estates; and whose good conduct in the discharge of his
     trust, naturally inclined my father to be of service to him, and on
     George Wickham, who was his god-son, his kindness was therefore
     liberally bestowed	3.2243
CHAPTER VII	1.0000
Darcy is over, I presume," said Miss
Bingley;--"and pray what is the result?"

"I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr	13.5140
Bennet, who fancied she had gained a complete
victory over him, continued her triumph	5.1795
In no countenance was attentive
curiosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley's, in spite of the
smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its
objects; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate, and her attentions
to Mr	4.6413
In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother's
words, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible
whisper; for to her inexpressible vexation, she could perceive that the
chief of it was overheard by Mr	4.9841
"

"I do not believe Mrs	9999.7238
My father and mother knew nothing of that, they only felt how
imprudent a match it must be	3.8740
On Saturday he came again	1.0000
After
pausing on this point a considerable while, she once more continued to
read	1.0000
This idea
lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view; the
turning past, he was immediately before them	1.0000
"If one could but go to Brighton!" observed Mrs	17.7825
The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently
characteristic	1.0000
Collins for
a few moments, he asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation
were very intimately acquainted with the family of de Bourgh	17.7805
Darcy would connect himself with a family, where to every other
objection would now be added, an alliance and relationship of the
nearest kind with the man whom he so justly scorned	2.0533
Jane should
therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his
attention	1.0000

"I will not be interrupted	99.9990
_I_ never saw such capacity, and taste, and
application, and elegance, as you describe, united	3.5932
Her tour to the Lakes
was now the object of her happiest thoughts; it was her best consolation
for all the uncomfortable hours, which the discontentedness of her
mother and Kitty made inevitable; and could she have included Jane in
the scheme, every part of it would have been perfect	9.1504
She endeavoured to secure Jane in
her interest, but Jane with all possible mildness declined
interfering;--and Elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness and
sometimes with playful gaiety replied to her attacks	1.0000

Elizabeth made no objection;--the door was then allowed to be shut, and
the carriage drove off	11.2849
Collins and
     myself sincerely sympathise with you, and all your respectable
     family, in your present distress, which must be of the bitterest
     kind, because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove	3.7270
She had only to say in
reply, that they had wandered about, till she was beyond her own
knowledge	11.2882
Yet he knew to the contrary himself	1.0000
He meant to provide for me amply,
and thought he had done it; but when the living fell, it was given
elsewhere	20.1456
Lydia has no
brothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from my father's
behaviour, from his indolence and the little attention he has ever
seemed to give to what was going forward in his family, that _he_ would
do as little, and think as little about it, as any father could do, in
such a matter	2.1015
Bennet," said she, "it is very hard to think that Charlotte
Lucas should ever be mistress of this house, that I should be forced to
make way for _her_, and live to see her take my place in it!"

"My dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts	32.3541
"

Not yet, however, in spite of her disappointment in her husband, did
Mrs	2153.1332

may be of service, if not to himself, to many others, for it must deter

boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy, and ventured to predict
the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former
letter	1.0000
It was over at last however	1.0000
"

"There is some sense in what he says about the girls however; and if he
is disposed to make them any amends, I shall not be the person to
discourage him	8.1091
Elizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused in
attending to what passed between Darcy and his companion	1.0000
Darcy more than once, but he believes that it was left to
him _conditionally_ only	26.8156
But I can assure the young ladies that I come
prepared to admire them	46.4042
Philips were now productive of the most interesting
intelligence	1.0000
"

"You judge very properly," said Mr	17.7827
I
shall now know how to act	1.0000
CHAPTER XV	1.0000
But
     last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice	1.0000
"Don't keep coughing so, Kitty, for heaven's sake! Have a little
compassion on my nerves	1.0000
We all love to
instruct, though we can teach only what is not worth knowing	1.0000
Forster,
the delight of Mrs	316.2188
"

Elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was
the case, and with equal sincerity could add that she firmly believed
and rejoiced in his domestic comforts	4.4165
Wickham, and of seeing a confirmation of every thing in Mr	99.9692
Darcy:--but let me not interrupt you,
Sir	1.0000
Darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter	17.7762
With _your_
good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of
others! Affectation of candour is common enough;--one meets it every
where	1.0000
Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr	1.0000
The children, two girls of six and eight years old, and two
younger boys, were to be left under the particular care of their cousin
Jane, who was the general favourite, and whose steady sense and
sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every
way--teaching them, playing with them, and loving them	2.9933
It is not to be supposed
that there was much affection in the case	316.2235
"

This letter gave Elizabeth some pain; but her spirits returned as she
considered that Jane would no longer be duped, by the sister at least	2.4242
She had
gained her point, and had time to consider of it	1.0000
There
could not exist in the world _two_ men, over whom Mr	1.0000
II	1.0000
"

"No--why should he? If it was not allowable for him to gain _my_
affections, because I had no money, what occasion could there be for
making love to a girl whom he did not care about, and who was equally
poor?"

"But there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her, so
soon after this event	46.3929
But he found, in reply to
     this question, that Wickham still cherished the hope of more
     effectually making his fortune by marriage, in some other country	5.5036
--How it could occur a second time therefore was
very odd!--Yet it did, and even a third	1.0000
I roused, and
interested you, because I was so unlike _them_	1.0000
--He carved, and ate, and praised with delighted
alacrity; and every dish was commended, first by him, and then by Sir
William, who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son in law
said, in a manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear	6.0847
In the hall they parted	1.0000
It makes me very nervous and poorly, to be thwarted
so in my own family, and to have neighbours who think of themselves
before anybody else	1.0000
But will they make you happy?"

"Have you any other objection," said Elizabeth, "than your belief of my
indifference?"

"None at all	1.0000
By many significant looks and silent
entreaties, did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of
complaisance,--but in vain; Mary would not understand them; such an
opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her, and she began her song	14.5445
You deserve no such attention	1.0000
Perhaps I am not doing her justice	1.0000
But, alas! the story which followed of his designs on Miss Darcy,
received some confirmation from what had passed between Colonel
Fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before; and at last she was
referred for the truth of every particular to Colonel Fitzwilliam
himself--from whom she had previously received the information of his
near concern in all his cousin's affairs, and whose character she had no
reason to question	1.0000
Jane listened with astonishment and concern;--she
knew not how to believe that Mr	5.1794
They repulsed
every attempt of Mrs	1.0000
Darcy, however, should
have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough, and
she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman, or
the insolent smiles of the ladies, were more intolerable	3.3260
She was afraid of talking longer of his
friend; and, having nothing else to say, was now determined to leave the
trouble of finding a subject to him	4.8929
"He is as fine a fellow," said Mr	166.8082
"

Miss Bingley made no answer; and soon afterwards got up and walked about
the room	131.2804
Are you quite sure that you feel what you ought
to do?"

"Oh, yes! You will only think I feel _more_ than I ought to do, when I
tell you all	6.8112
That he is
as false and deceitful, as he is insinuating	1.0000
If I were not afraid of judging harshly, I should
     be almost tempted to say, that there is a strong appearance of
     duplicity in all this	5.8773
They soon outstripped the others, and when they had
reached the carriage, Mr	34.5353
The business was therefore soon settled	1.0000
"

"I think you said she was a widow, sir? has she any family?"

"She has one only daughter, the heiress of Rosings, and of very
extensive property	8.1091
A fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de
Bourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant; and the respect which he
felt for her high rank, and his veneration for her as his patroness,
mingling with a very good opinion of himself, of his authority as a
clergyman, and his rights as a rector, made him altogether a mixture of
pride and obsequiousness, self-importance and humility	1.3708
"They have both," said she, "been deceived, I dare say, in some way or
other, of which we can form no idea	29.0287
He had found the law a most unprofitable study,
     and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained, if I would
     present him to the living in question--of which he trusted there
     could be little doubt, as he was well assured that I had no other
     person to provide for, and I could not have forgotten my revered
     father's intentions	2.0534

this half hour, and master has had a letter	1.0000

sure, and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than Jane	13.5177

You have no compassion on my poor nerves	1.0000
CHAPTER V	1.0000
The church _ought_ to have been my profession--I
was brought up for the church, and I should at this time have been in
possession of a most valuable living, had it pleased the gentleman we
were speaking of just now	8.9590
Accordingly, when she retired at night, she asked the chambermaid
whether Pemberley were not a very fine place, what was the name of its
proprietor, and with no little alarm, whether the family were down for
the summer	1.7535
Mr	1.0000
Bingley was by no means deficient,
but Darcy was clever	12.9154
This is my advice	1.0000
Why does she not come in?"

"Oh! Charlotte says, she hardly ever does	1.0000
In anticipating the happiness of Bingley,
which of course was to be inferior only to his own, he continued the
conversation till they reached the house	14.2477
I should be sorry, you know,
to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in Derbyshire	387.8922
I cannot find
out that I hate her at all, or that I am in the least unwilling to think
her a very good sort of girl	166.7360
I really do not think Georgiana
Darcy has her equal for beauty, elegance, and accomplishments; and the
affection she inspires in Louisa and myself, is heightened into
something still more interesting, from the hope we dare to entertain of
her being hereafter our sister	1.0000
and
Mrs	1.0000
Darcy, who never looks at any
woman but to see a blemish, and who probably never looked at _you_ in
his life! It is admirable!"

Elizabeth tried to join in her father's pleasantry, but could only force
one most reluctant smile	2.7213
They will have nothing else to
do	99.9407
Had she merely _dined_ with him, she might
only have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you must
remember that four evenings have been also spent together--and four
evenings may do a great deal	1.0000
"

"But if you have got them to-day," said Elizabeth, "my mother's purpose
will be answered	10.7110
"

"Mr	1.0000
As her successor in that house, she
regarded her with jealous abhorrence	1.0000
When the engagement was for home, some of the officers always
made part of it, of which officers Mr	1.0000
--Pray, what is your age?"

"With three younger sisters grown up," replied Elizabeth smiling, "your
Ladyship can hardly expect me to own it	1.0000
He spoke of it as a certain event,
     of which the time alone could be undecided	1.0000
"She is so fond of Mrs	99.9999
But whatever may be the sentiments which Mr	1.0000
Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabeth
again, having still a great deal to say to her, and many enquiries to
make after all their Hertfordshire friends	9.9980
The Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the
world, though only a few weeks before, when Lydia had first run away,
they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune	3.4714
"

Then, perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying, she added,
"Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia, we may draw from it this useful
lesson; that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable--that one false
step involves her in endless ruin--that her reputation is no less
brittle than it is beautiful,--and that she cannot be too much guarded
in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex	3.2182
She felt that she had no business at
Pemberley, and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it	12.9133
In this danger Kitty
is also comprehended	1.0000
Recovering himself, however, shortly,
he turned to his partner, and said,

"Sir William's interruption has made me forget what we were talking of	5.1628
Collins was first introduced to her
notice, but he certainly has not known her long	1.0000
Bingley's attentions to her sister, Elizabeth
was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some
interest in the eyes of his friend	34.5392

Darcy with him, and sat down
again by her sister	239.8345
I must confess myself
     surprised by your application; I did not expect it from _you_	26.8211
"While Mary is adjusting her ideas," he continued, "let us return to Mr	74.9611
One seems so forlorn without them	1.0000
"

"Indeed you are mistaken	1.0000
With assumed tranquillity he then replied, "I have no wish of denying
that I did every thing in my power to separate my friend from your
sister, or that I rejoice in my success	30.7539
"

Mr	1.0000
Darcy were by no means over	315.9933
Bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for Lydia's
interruption, and promised that it should not occur again, if he would
resume his book; but Mr	2.3460
Mr	1.0000
Darcy; the latter of whom, however,
could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of _her_, in spite of
all Miss Bingley's witticisms on _fine eyes_	22.2616
"

Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it, and
they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put
an end to cards; and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr	5.8776
Wickham is safe	1.0000
--Your mother will never see you
again if you do _not_ marry Mr	6.8112
But perhaps Mr	1.0000
Darcy had at first scarcely
allowed her to be pretty; he had looked at her without admiration at the
ball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise	4.0366

in undiminished beauty; and more than once during dinner did Mr	4.6407
Collins for the knowledge of what carriages went
along, and how often especially Miss De Bourgh drove by in her phaeton,
which he never failed coming to inform them of, though it happened
almost every day	1.0000
Into _one_ house in this
neighbourhood, they shall never have admittance	9.9970
Darcy had been at her
sister's wedding	46.4150
These
were the contents:

     "MY DEAR HARRIET,

     "You will laugh when you know where I am gone, and I cannot help
     laughing myself at your surprise to-morrow morning, as soon as I am
     missed	19.1432
So imprudent a
     match on both sides!--But I am willing to hope the best, and that
     his character has been misunderstood	2.7210
She answered in the affirmative, and, unable to resist
the temptation, added, "When you met us there the other day, we had just
been forming a new acquaintance	8.6580
Bennet, was not so well pleased with it	1.0000
My dear Jane, Mr	2154.3537

Her father was walking about the room, looking grave and anxious	9.9999
Pray go to see them, with Sir William and Maria	1.0000
Such very
superior dancing is not often seen	1.0000
Bennet's expectations were fully answered	1.0000
Jenkinson was
arranging Miss de Bourgh's foot-stool, that she said, 'Mr	1.0000
"You either chuse this method of passing
the evening because you are in each other's confidence and have secret
affairs to discuss, or because you are conscious that your figures
appear to the greatest advantage in walking;--if the first, I should be
completely in your way;--and if the second, I can admire you much better
as I sit by the fire	1.3894
"

But Jane could think with certainty on only one point,--that Mr	1.0000
Collins and Lizzy	1.0000
"

"No," said Colonel Fitzwilliam, "that is an advantage which he must
divide with me	166.7265
Believe her to be deceived by all means	1.0000
gutenberg	1.0000
I have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will
include you and my sister Maria in every invitation with which she

"

"Nay, if you are so serious about it, I shall consider the matter as
absolutely settled	3.5932
"

"It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire	9.9999
I cannot think of it without abhorrence	130.4803
Collins met for breakfast a few
minutes before the others appeared; and he took the opportunity of
paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary	1.0000
--"Louisa, you will not mind my
waking Mr	1.0000

Mrs	1.0000

you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on
them, as nonsense? I cannot quite agree with you _there_	3.3598
Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday; on Tuesday, his wife received a
letter from him; it told them, that on his arrival, he had immediately
found out his brother, and persuaded him to come to Gracechurch street	3.1620
With a
book he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had a
good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised
such splendid expectations	8.6572
But
Lizzy, you have been very sly, very reserved with me	1.0000
They have at
least that advantage	1.0000
As soon as they entered the copse, Lady Catherine began in the following
manner:--

"You can be at no loss, Miss Bennet, to understand the reason of my
journey hither	22.4033
Bennet
was restored to her usual querulous serenity, and by the middle of June
Kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton without
tears; an event of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth hope, that by
the following Christmas, she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to
mention an officer above once a day, unless by some cruel and malicious
arrangement at the war-office, another regiment should be quartered in
Meryton	1.3288
Collins, was convinced that
they were talking of the Longbourn estate, and resolving to turn herself
and her daughters out of the house, as soon as Mr	76.2578
F	1.0000
Indeed, Mr	1.0000
Elizabeth soon heard from her friend; and their
correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been; that it
should be equally unreserved was impossible	2.3460
It was
generally evident whenever they met, that he _did_ admire her; and to
_her_ it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference
which she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a
way to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that it
was not likely to be discovered by the world in general, since Jane
united with great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and a
uniform cheerfulness of manner, which would guard her from the
suspicions of the impertinent	10.2334
E	1.0000
But in all, and in almost every line of each, there was a want of that
cheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style, and which,
proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself, and kindly
disposed towards every one, had been scarcely ever clouded	2.3843
"

"Insolent girl!" said Elizabeth to herself	1.0000
Your
     father was gone, your uncle at home, and, as I said before, they
     had a great deal of talk together	54.8229
Darcy,
she saw on looking up that Colonel Fitzwilliam was meeting her	8.1112
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come	2.0533
Her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what
she did not believe herself, that his attentions to Jane had been merely
the effect of a common and transient liking, which ceased when he saw
her no more; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at
the time, she had the same story to repeat every day	4.6413
"

"You have a very small park here," returned Lady Catherine after a short
silence	17.7794
The family were assembled in the breakfast room, to receive
them	1.0000
She was met in the vestibule by Lydia, who, flying to
her, cried in a half whisper, "I am glad you are come, for there is such
fun here!--What do you think has happened this morning?--Mr	9.2683
Darcy," observed Miss Bingley, in a half whisper,
"that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine
eyes	7.4038
I have known him
too long and too well to be a fair judge	6.8112
He shall not be in love with me, if I
can prevent it	46.3929
Bennet, and
we shall very soon settle it with her, I am sure	1193.4989
Mr	1.0000
Darcy's explanation
_there_, had appeared very insufficient; and she read it again	5.8767
That among his own connections he was
esteemed and valued--that even Wickham had allowed him merit as a
brother, and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of
his sister as to prove him capable of _some_ amiable feeling	2.9934
"I am by no means of opinion, I assure you," said he, "that a ball of
this kind, given by a young man of character, to respectable people, can
have any evil tendency; and I am so far from objecting to dancing myself
that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins
in the course of the evening, and I take this opportunity of soliciting
yours, Miss Elizabeth, for the two first dances especially,--a
preference which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right
cause, and not to any disrespect for her	19.2935
Do let me ask my partner to introduce you	1.0000
Jane was already so much recovered
as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening	15.0079
"

"I beg your pardon	716.3584
Any thing beyond
the very neighbourhood of Longbourn, I suppose, would appear far	5.8780
It settled the matter; and they pursued the accustomed
circuit; which brought them again, after some time, in a descent among
hanging woods, to the edge of the water, in one of its narrowest parts	5.8767

disagreeable?"

Elizabeth excused herself as well as she could; said that she had liked
him better when they met in Kent than before, and that she had never
seen him so pleasant as this morning	6.8112
She has two nieces
of her own	1.0000
Darcy is so violent,
that it would be the death of half the good people in Meryton, to
attempt to place him in an amiable light	2.8046
Mr	1.0000
There was certainly at this moment, in Elizabeth's mind, a more gentle
sensation towards the original, than she had ever felt in the height of
their acquaintance	4.8934
What sister would think
herself at liberty to do it, unless there were something very
objectionable? If they believed him attached to me, they would not try
to part us; if he were so, they could not succeed	4.2162

But she had never felt so
strongly as now, the disadvantages which must attend the children of so
unsuitable a marriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils
arising from so ill-judged a direction of talents; talents which rightly
used, might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters,
even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife	1.4250

of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien; and
the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after
his entrance, of his having ten thousand a year	1.7534
Darcy before they
had known any thing of the matter	1.0000
I happened to overhear the
gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of
this house the names of his cousin Miss de Bourgh, and of her mother
Lady Catherine	8.6588
Jenkinson to make up her
party	1.0000
Bennet, with great civility, begged her ladyship to take some
refreshment; but Lady Catherine very resolutely, and not very politely,
declined eating any thing; and then rising up, said to Elizabeth,

"Miss Bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness
on one side of your lawn	10.8241

Whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing
her, she could not tell, but he certainly had not seen her with
composure	7.6077
--Come, Kitty, I want you up stairs	17.7762
He was writing, and, without raising his head,
coolly replied,

"Just as you please	15.0079
She dared not
even mention that gentleman	99.9407

appearance of it	34.5429

"His manners are very different from his cousin's	1.0000

of the pictures, the dimensions of the rooms, and the price of the
furniture, in vain	8.9602
Miss
Bingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the
first opportunity of saying, with sneering civility,

"Pray, Miss Eliza, are not the ----shire militia removed from Meryton?
They must be a great loss to _your_ family	16.5748

that ours is not a family, on which it could be thrown away	12.0497
Elizabeth's collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emotion; and
as Miss Bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not approach nearer to
Wickham, Georgiana also recovered in time, though not enough to be able
to speak any more	2.9934
The Gardiners staid a week at Longbourn; and what with the Philipses,
the Lucases, and the officers, there was not a day without its
engagement	71.0657
--It pains me to offend you	1.0000
I shall not sport with your impatience, by reading what he says
on that point	5.1784
Mr	1.0000
I am sick of them all	315.9933
Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to
supper; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the
others, and she had no opportunity of detaining them	21.5379
"

"My dear Jane!" exclaimed Elizabeth, "you are too good	9993.8420
She had a sister married to a Mr	1.0000
Could he expect that her friends
would not step forward? Could he expect to be noticed again by the
regiment, after such an affront to Colonel Forster? His temptation is
not adequate to the risk	1.0000
But they were entirely ignorant of what had passed; and their raptures
continued with little intermission to the very day of Lydia's leaving
home	17.7805
Though I
shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill; and if I was
her, I would not have put up with it	2.5119
"MY DEAR BROTHER,

     "At last I am able to send you some tidings of my niece, and such
     as, upon the whole, I hope will give you satisfaction	8.6572
I found that
Miss Darcy was expected to dinner	26.8156
"

"Well, my dear," said Mr	9212.7566
Collins seemed neither in need
of encouragement, nor inclined to be silent himself	1.0000
"

"Thank you--but I always mend my own	12.9112
"It is a long time, Mr	2783.6707
And you saw the
old housekeeper, I suppose? Poor Reynolds, she was always very fond of
me	1.0000
That the wish of giving happiness to you, might add force to the other
inducements which led me on, I shall not attempt to deny	2.5116
Darcy, was one of the best men
that ever breathed, and the truest friend I ever had; and I can never be
in company with this Mr	2.2756
And when
the party entered the assembly room, it consisted of only five
altogether; Mr	1.0000
Happy shall I be, when his stay at Netherfield is over!"

"I wish I could say any thing to comfort you," replied Elizabeth; "but
it is wholly out of my power	1.0000
Her answer, therefore, was not propitious, at
least not to Elizabeth's wishes, for she was impatient to get home	2.8477
"It was greatly my wish that he should do so," he added, "as soon
     as his marriage was fixed on	8.5374
You refuse, then, to oblige me	1.0000
Gardiner and
her niece, however, did her justice, and pitied her	6.8129
Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield
party	1.0000
That _she_ could
be in any danger from the deception never entered my head	1.0000
"He
only told me, what I have now told you	9.9970
From something that he told me in
our journey hither, I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted to
him	3.1618
Once or twice she could discern a faint blush; but in general
Charlotte wisely did not hear	1.0000
"

It was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that embarrassment,
from which she had been so wholly free at first	22.9252
Though I
_know_ it must be a scandalous falsehood; though I would not injure him
so much as to suppose the truth of it possible, I instantly resolved on
setting off for this place, that I might make my sentiments known to
you	1.6876
He even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity	166.7530
And now nothing
remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the
violence of my affection	1.0000
Darcy then
was	1.0000
_I_ should be
ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me	1.0000
Her dirty petticoat
quite escaped my notice	1.0000
And
     will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances
     to his creditors in Meryton, of whom I shall subjoin a list,
     according to his information	2.3460
He had entertained hopes of being
admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he had heard
much; but he saw only the father	5.5042
Perhaps I
did not always love him so well as I do now	8.1113
But I am particularly
attached to these young men; and know them to be so much attached to
me!--They were excessively sorry to go! But so they always are	2.3462
Lady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew;
and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character, in
her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement, she sent him
language so very abusive, especially of Elizabeth, that for some time
all intercourse was at an end	5.0314
"

Consoled by this resolution, she was the better able to bear her
husband's incivility; though it was very mortifying to know that her
neighbours might all see Mr	2.1542
All that is known after this is, that they were seen
     to continue the London road	21.5358
"Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs	6425.1737
Very little was said by either; Kitty was
too much afraid of him to talk; Elizabeth was secretly forming a
desperate resolution; and perhaps he might be doing the same	1.0000
They were ignorant, idle, and vain	46.3929
Miss Bingley's letter arrived, and put an end to doubt	99.9698
Could she have seen half as much love in Mr	1.0000
Mrs	1.0000
"

"What think you of books?" said he, smiling	26.8156
They
had all been very ill-used since she last saw her sister	1.0000
Bennet gone away, and I know he will fight
Wickham, wherever he meets him, and then he will be killed, and what is
to become of us all? The Collinses will turn us out, before he is cold
in his grave; and if you are not kind to us, brother, I do not know what
we shall do	4.4165
"

Elizabeth's misery increased, at such unnecessary, such officious
attention! Were the same fair prospect to arise at present, as had
flattered them a year ago, every thing, she was persuaded, would be
hastening to the same vexatious conclusion	1.0000
Darcy's behaviour astonished and vexed her	1.0000
Four nieces
of Mrs	1.0000
Every body is disgusted with his pride	1.0000
Their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she could
regard with any complacency	15.0079
"

"Can such abominable pride as his, have ever done him good?"

"Yes	1.0000
The whole of what Elizabeth had already
heard, his claims on Mr	1.0000
"

"I did not think you would;--and that being the case, I cannot consider
your situation with much compassion	20.1507
"

But Elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with them,
laughingly answered,

"No, no; stay where you are	2.5116
"

Elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he afterwards
took occasion to ask her, when unattended to by any of the rest,
whether _all_ her sisters were at Longbourn	1.9684
--But
     from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally
     bestowed, respecting each circumstance, I shall hope to be in
     future secured, when the following account of my actions and their
     motives has been read	1.7781
CHAPTER X	1.0000
"There
is nothing the matter with me	2152.3049
At first there
seemed danger of Lydia's engrossing him entirely, for she was a most
determined talker; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets,
she soon grew too much interested in the game, too eager in making bets
and exclaiming after prizes, to have attention for any one in
particular	2.3099
Bennet, "you
will wait on him of course	316.2212
--Oh! had I known what
I ought, what I dared, to do! But I knew not--I was afraid of doing too
much	1.0000
A
most delightful place!--Excellent Parsonage House! It would have suited
me in every respect	1.0000
--Pursuing her way along the lane, she then began it	9.9970
Bennet, have you no more lanes
hereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her way again to-day?"

"I advise Mr	1.0000
With the kindest concern he
     came on to Longbourn, and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner
     most creditable to his heart	2.8480
"

"I am talking of possibilities, Charles	26.8265
She now lost every expectation of pleasure	1.0000
"

"Yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near Cheapside	1.0000
They contained no actual complaint, nor was there any
revival of past occurrences, or any communication of present suffering	1.0000
"

"I must think your language too strong in speaking of both," replied
Jane, "and I hope you will be convinced of it, by seeing them happy
together	5.4063
' Allow me, by the
way, to observe, my fair cousin, that I do not reckon the notice and
kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the
advantages in my power to offer	10.6073
The recollection of what I
then said, of my conduct, my manners, my expressions during the whole of
it, is now, and has been many months, inexpressibly painful to me	1.9682
His behaviour to myself has been
scandalous; but I verily believe I could forgive him any thing and every
thing, rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory
of his father	2.0091
"

Another intreaty that she would be serious, however, produced the
desired effect; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn assurances of
attachment	1.0000
Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so--but still they admired
her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and one whom
they should not object to know more of	12.0487
I depend on you for that	1.0000
Elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had, from the distress of
the moment, been led to make Mr	31.6087
Darcy?"

"As much as I ever wish to be," cried Elizabeth warmly,--"I have spent
four days in the same house with him, and I think him very
disagreeable	1.0000
Bennet," as she entered the room, "we have had a most
delightful evening, a most excellent ball	31.6178
"

Her performance was pleasing, though by no means capital	12.9112
Elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her
delight in the prospect of their relationship	8.1091
"I have found out," said he, "by a singular accident, that there is now
in the room a near relation of my patroness	72.3550
She had scarcely needed her
present observation to be satisfied, from the reason of things, that
their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love, rather
than by his; and she would have wondered why, without violently caring
for her, he chose to elope with her at all, had she not felt certain
that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances; and
if that were the case, he was not the young man to resist an opportunity
of having a companion	7.2463
What made you so shy of me, when you first
called, and afterwards dined here? Why, especially, when you called, did
you look as if you did not care about me?"

"Because you were grave and silent, and gave me no encouragement	4.2162
"

Elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement, but was too much oppressed to
make any reply	4.2162
Denny had
brought him from London, and that he was to have a lieutenant's
commission in the ----shire	427.9315
He began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too much attention	9.9970
Never mind Miss
Lizzy's hair	1.0000
E	1.0000
Your tempers are by no means unlike	1.0000
She answered him with cold civility	1.0000
Darcy they had
only seen at church	1.0000
How you must have hated me after _that_ evening?"

"Hate you! I was angry perhaps at first, but my anger soon began to take
a proper direction	1.0000
Collins,
was a most humiliating picture!--And to the pang of a friend disgracing
herself and sunk in her esteem, was added the distressing conviction
that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot
she had chosen	2.8477
But as to your
other objection, I am afraid it will hardly hold good	34.5431
But Jane and Elizabeth, who
agreed in wishing, for the sake of their sister's feelings and
consequence, that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents,
urged him so earnestly, yet so rationally and so mildly, to receive her
and her husband at Longbourn, as soon as they were married, that he was
prevailed on to think as they thought, and act as they wished	3.7407
His revenge would have been complete indeed	1.0000
"

She did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses
were engaged	5.1794
When they repaired to the
dining-room, Elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether Bingley would take
the place, which, in all their former parties, had belonged to him, by
her sister	2.0092

Transcriber's note:

      Text enclosed by underscores is in italics (_italics_)	5.8767
I am
perfectly satisfied from what his manners now are, that he never had any
design of engaging my affection	45.0308
"

"That is very true," said Elizabeth; "though it had not occurred to me
before	16.2504
Collins's side, and as many bows on Sir William's, they departed	1.0000
Bennet, "that is very unlucky	222.6166
"

"An excellent consolation in its way," said Elizabeth, "but it will not
do for _us_	19.9193
What a contrast did it offer to his last address in Rosing's Park, when
he put his letter into her hand! She knew not what to think, nor how to
account for it	2.8477
She went on	1.0000
If, as I conclude will be the case, you send me full powers to act
     in your name, throughout the whole of this business, I will
     immediately give directions to Haggerston for preparing a proper
     settlement	3.3595
And pray, Lizzy, what said Lady Catherine
about this report? Did she call to refuse her consent?"

To this question his daughter replied only with a laugh; and as it had
been asked without the least suspicion, she was not distressed by his
repeating it	1.0000
"My dear Madam," he replied, "this invitation is particularly
gratifying, because it is what I have been hoping to receive; and you
may be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon as
possible	28.3301
Philips was always glad to see her nieces, and the two eldest, from
their recent absence, were particularly welcome, and she was eagerly
expressing her surprise at their sudden return home, which, as their own
carriage had not fetched them, she should have known nothing about, if
she had not happened to see Mr	4.6411
I thought it my duty
to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin, that she and
her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about, and not run
hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned	5.1787
Collins,
gratefully accepted, and immediately ordered	1.0000
gutenberg	1.0000
Darcy's using him ill, it is perfectly false; for, on the contrary, he
has been always remarkably kind to him, though George Wickham has
treated Mr	2.5252
Mr	1.0000
"I can comprehend your going on charmingly, when
you had once made a beginning; but what could set you off in the first
place?"

"I cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the words, which
laid the foundation	12.9127
Hurst and Miss Bingley, and the lady with whom she lived in
London	316.0700
The looks and behaviour of every body they had seen were
discussed, except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention	1.0000
And to be kept back on _such_ a motive!--I think it
would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of
mind	6.3088
It would have been strange if they had	46.4150
"

"I should never have considered the distance as one of the _advantages_
of the match," cried Elizabeth	37.9208
What
could be more natural than his asking you again? He could not help
seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in
the room	12.9112
Mr	1.0000
One cannot wonder that so
very fine a young man, with family, fortune, every thing in his favour,
should think highly of himself	5.8767
"

"It is well	2154.3537
You blamed me for coming?"

"No indeed; I felt nothing but surprise	1.0000
Bennet and
the children	1.0000
Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily
attached to her situation, that she could, upon the whole, have no cause
to repine	2.5119
Darcy was attending them to their
carriage, Miss Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on
Elizabeth's person, behaviour, and dress	2.7210
The united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters
and of his overpowering friend, assisted by the attractions of Miss
Darcy and the amusements of London, might be too much, she feared, for
the strength of his attachment	1.8046
"

"Sir, you quite misunderstand me," said Mrs	99.9698
He knows where we live	1.0000
--I
am excessively attentive to all those things	26.8265
"

"I never can be thankful, Mr	1.0000
Did you see it?"

Bingley replied that he did, and made his congratulations	1.0000
Elizabeth had mentioned her
name to her mother, on her ladyship's entrance, though no request of
introduction had been made	2.9936
Let me recommend you, however, as a friend,
not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions; for as to Mr	7.4047
But I am at his disposal	316.2188
