"

"Their conduct has been such," replied Elizabeth, "as neither you, nor
I, nor any body, can ever forget	2148.7800
--Elizabeth instantly read her feelings, and at that moment
solicitude for Wickham, resentment against his enemies, and every thing
else gave way before the hope of Jane's being in the fairest way for
happiness	2529.4439
Collins! my dear Charlotte,--impossible!"

The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her
story, gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a
reproach; though, as it was no more than she expected, she soon
regained her composure, and calmly replied,

"Why should you be surprised, my dear Eliza?--Do you think it incredible
that Mr	590.8649
I quite detest the man	6792.3102
"You have no regard, then, for the honour and credit of my nephew!
Unfeeling, selfish girl! Do you not consider that a connection with you,
must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody?"

"Lady Catherine, I have nothing farther to say	1433.8966
Her figure was elegant, and she walked well;--but Darcy, at
whom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly studious	2366.8693
"

"I do, I do like him," she replied, with tears in her eyes, "I love him	876.3329
They have each their
advantages, and I can be equally happy in either	2601.8612
Though suspicion was very far
from Miss Bennet's general habits, she was absolutely incredulous here	2892.5296

a good memory is unpardonable	3843.2144

Gardiner's
long letter, but now, having _that_ to communicate which she knew would
be most welcome, she was almost ashamed to find, that her uncle and aunt
had already lost three days of happiness, and immediately wrote as
follows:

     "I would have thanked you before, my dear aunt, as I ought to have
     done, for your long, kind, satisfactory, detail of particulars; but
     to say the truth, I was too cross to write	2186.4118
They could
not be untouched by his politeness, and had they drawn his character
from their own feelings, and his servant's report, without any reference
to any other account, the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known,
would not have recognised it for Mr	2180.9862

address most truly the gentleman	3447.4519
"

"I will not trust myself on the subject," replied Wickham, "_I_ can
hardly be just to him	1323.9538
When he was gone, they were certain at least of receiving constant
information of what was going on, and their uncle promised, at parting,
to prevail on Mr	2717.3177
gutenberg	10073.4590
Bennet's leaving them together, after a
longer irritation than usual about Netherfield and its master, she could
not help saying,

"Oh! that my dear mother had more command over herself; she can have no
idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him	1693.1637
I longed to
know whether he would be married in his blue coat	2418.9483
But she is nothing to me now	1839.7394

She wished, she
feared that the master of the house might be amongst them; and whether
she wished or feared it most, she could scarcely determine	2453.4800
Collins must excuse
me	8188.9036
"

"_You_ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room," said Mr	1406.2478
Gardiner, whose curiosity
as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive	2461.0415
Hurst had therefore nothing to do, but to stretch himself on one of the
sophas and go to sleep	2756.1044
Gardiner would be prevented by business from
setting out till a fortnight later in July, and must be in London again
within a month; and as that left too short a period for them to go so
far, and see so much as they had proposed, or at least to see it with
the leisure and comfort they had built on, they were obliged to give up
the Lakes, and substitute a more contracted tour; and, according to the
present plan, were to go no farther northward than Derbyshire	2499.7913

Gardiner and the children were to remain in Hertfordshire a few
days longer, as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to
her nieces	2659.6886
But, perhaps his sister does as well
for the present, and, as she is under his sole care, he may do what he
likes with her	1884.9632
Bennet, "but it is a comfort to think that, whatever of
that kind may befal you, you have an affectionate mother who will always
make the most of it	1923.2663
Collins would have led them round his two meadows,
but the ladies not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white
frost, turned back; and while Sir William accompanied him, Charlotte
took her sister and friend over the house, extremely well pleased,
probably, to have the opportunity of shewing it without her husband's
help	3493.6797
I came to try you	4561.3364
W	10070.3375
After a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with

"It is _your_ turn to say something now, Mr	3480.3017
March was to take
Elizabeth to Hunsford	3639.1829
"

"He is a sweet tempered, amiable, charming man	3645.1776
Morris immediately; that he is
to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be
in the house by the end of next week	1576.6325
Had he done his duty in that
respect, Lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle, for whatever of
honour or credit could now be purchased for her	3559.2981
"

"It is more than I engage for, I assure you	1401.5240
The
subject was pursued no farther, and the gentlemen soon afterwards went
away	2263.6102
But now she would no longer
conceal from her, his share in Lydia's marriage	2726.9586
--The envelope itself was likewise
full	8427.1169
He heard her attentively, and then said,

"Lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public
place or other, and we can never expect her to do it with so little
expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present
circumstances	2729.8379
Wickham	10188.6530
And it is the more to be lamented, because there is reason to
     suppose, as my dear Charlotte informs me, that this licentiousness
     of behaviour in your daughter, has proceeded from a faulty degree
     of indulgence, though, at the same time, for the consolation of
     yourself and Mrs	2081.5562
"

Then turning to Mr	5200.6618
Bingley comes, my dear," said Mrs	1200.2295
From the farther disadvantage of Lydia's
society she was of course carefully kept, and though Mrs	3428.7278
--The
possibility of his having really endured such unkindness, was enough to
interest all her tender feelings; and nothing therefore remained to be
done, but to think well of them both, to defend the conduct of each, and
throw into the account of accident or mistake, whatever could not be
otherwise explained	2502.3772
It does not necessarily follow that a deep,
intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours	5585.9013
Bennet, who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the
affair as she wished, was excessively disappointed	2375.5188
Now and then, they were honoured with a call from her Ladyship,
and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during
these visits	2349.7024
Had Lydia's marriage been
concluded on the most honourable terms, it was not to be supposed that
Mr	1877.0875
"This is a parade," cried he, "which does one good; it gives such an
elegance to misfortune! Another day I will do the same; I will sit in
my library, in my night cap and powdering gown, and give as much trouble
as I can,--or, perhaps, I may defer it, till Kitty runs away	2369.5295
--Lady Catherine was a tall, large woman, with
strongly-marked features, which might once have been handsome	2985.4268
"Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?" said Miss Bingley; "will
she be as tall as I am?"

"I think she will	2441.6449
Such I was, from eight to eight and twenty; and such I might
still have been but for you, dearest, loveliest Elizabeth! What do I not
owe you! You taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most
advantageous	2902.1783
"

"You must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that your
refusal of my addresses is merely words of course	2389.8963
At such a distance as _that_, you know, things are strangely
misrepresented	3606.9432
Bennet, "to walk
to Oakham Mount this morning	2610.6842
The hill, crowned with wood, from
which they had descended, receiving increased abruptness from the
distance, was a beautiful object	4912.5837
It adds even another motive	10119.7046
He joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their
aunt's, where his regret and vexation, and the concern of every body was
well talked over	3272.5876
Wickham passed all his youth there, you
know	3173.6251
CHAPTER XVI	6939.4745
Collins's conversation to herself	3854.8579
"I told you the other day,
of his infamous behaviour to Mr	1528.6754
Reynolds, either
from pride or attachment, had evidently great pleasure in talking of her
master and his sister	3362.2330
When the ladies were separating for the toilette, he said to Elizabeth,

"Do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your apparel	2210.4687
Bingley and Jane, however, soon allowed the others to
outstrip them	2675.7608
I want to talk very seriously	4525.1570
Till I was in Kent, and saw
so much both of Mr	1760.6855
"

Away ran the girls, too eager to get in to have time for speech	4683.8536
"

She would not give him time to reply, but hurrying instantly to her
husband, called out as she entered the library,

"Oh! Mr	1572.1033
6	10071.8984
She had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of his
being partial to her, but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea; and Mrs	1956.0009
"

"We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that
evening," said Elizabeth	2312.2908
He had never before supposed
that, could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter, it would be
done with so little inconvenience to himself, as by the present
arrangement	2098.1852
This was his plan of amends--of atonement--for inheriting their father's
estate; and he thought it an excellent one, full of eligibility and
suitableness, and excessively generous and disinterested on his own
part	3876.5142
Darcy's
shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict, gave her a
keener sense of her sister's sufferings	2292.3911
Gardiner	10125.5165
"
Charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful, and
that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time	2318.3482
He was always to have gone on
Saturday, and to Saturday he still meant to stay	2720.1839
Forster to Meryton,
from whence they were to set out early the next morning	2855.8144
But it
was her business to be satisfied--and certainly her temper to be happy;
and all was soon right again	2184.4526
YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE	10165.1381
"

"He likes to have his own way very well," replied Colonel Fitzwilliam	1822.8647
Elizabeth received her
congratulations amongst the rest, and then, sick of this folly, took
refuge in her own room, that she might think with freedom	2366.7814
The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every
female of the family	2513.2005
--Are you much acquainted with Mr	4709.2559
"

"Such as vanity and pride	5080.8328
Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my
positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand; for I
have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the
blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation	4499.7809
The families who had been in town for the winter came
back again, and summer finery and summer engagements arose	2696.7249
It was an evening of no common delight to them all; the satisfaction of
Miss Bennet's mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face, as
made her look handsomer than ever	2712.9343
"

"Oh! it is of no consequence	324.4310
CHAPTER XII	6939.4745
_Your_
retrospections must be so totally void of reproach, that the contentment
arising from them, is not of philosophy, but what is much better, of
ignorance	2647.7223
Proud that in a cause of compassion and honour, he had been able to get
the better of himself	1965.8971
"Why, if he came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent," said she,
"did he come at all?"

She could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure	1218.7504
I shall walk to Meryton to-morrow to hear more
about it, and to ask when Mr	2063.7108
Oh! he is the handsomest young man that
ever was seen!"

Wickham, Lydia, were all forgotten	160.9451
If I may so express it, he has a _right_
to be proud	2308.5851
It
gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast; for she was in
no cheerful humour	2626.8749
Till this moment, I never knew myself	2853.8523
"Oh! Mary," said she, "I wish you had gone with us, for we had such fun!
as we went along, Kitty and me drew up all the blinds, and pretended
there was nobody in the coach; and I should have gone so all the way, if
Kitty had not been sick; and when we got to the George, I do think we
behaved very handsomely, for we treated the other three with the nicest
cold luncheon in the world, and if you would have gone, we would have
treated you too	244.3104
You know my sentiments	4594.2995
Collins has yet
expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us, but I am very
certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for
it	2384.1645
Bennet was really in a most pitiable state	2341.7583
It was a painful, but
not an improbable, conjecture	2752.8474
Collins wants to marry Lizzy?"

Nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne
without anger such treatment; but Sir William's good breeding carried
him through it all; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the
truth of his information, he listened to all their impertinence with the
most forbearing courtesy	1735.6820
I do not wish to avoid the walk	1706.8586
--No one who has ever seen you
together, can doubt his affection	4986.7985
Collins's respectability, and
Charlotte's prudent, steady character	3707.8118
She wanted to ascertain the
feelings of each of her visitors, she wanted to compose her own, and to
make herself agreeable to all; and in the latter object, where she
feared most to fail, she was most sure of success, for those to whom she
endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour	2165.9704
She had
got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight,
and was certain of a willing listener in Jane, whenever she might wish
to talk again of either	2555.3527
Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1	5274.8188
"

He listened to her with perfect indifference, while she chose to
entertain herself in this manner, and as his composure convinced her
that all was safe, her wit flowed long	2736.1985
"I have not the pleasure of understanding you," said he, when she had
finished her speech	968.8157
In
confirmation of this, she related the particulars of all the pecuniary
transactions in which they had been connected, without actually naming
her authority, but stating it to be such as might be relied on	2441.3463
Bennet give up the point	4714.4531
Lydia--the
humiliation, the misery, she was bringing on them all, soon swallowed up
every private care; and covering her face with her handkerchief,
Elizabeth was soon lost to every thing else; and, after a pause of
several minutes, was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the
voice of her companion, who, in a manner, which though it spoke
compassion, spoke likewise restraint, said, "I am afraid you have been
long desiring my absence, nor have I any thing to plead in excuse of my
stay, but real, though unavailing, concern	2343.6887
Lady Catherine was reckoned proud by many
people he knew, but _he_ had never seen any thing but affability in her	3448.2085
"

"And this," cried Darcy, as he walked with quick steps across the room,
"is your opinion of me! This is the estimation in which you hold me! I
thank you for explaining it so fully	1237.3482
I congratulate her	9456.5261
Hurst, who had
married a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider
his house as her home when it suited her	3982.7625
Her enquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered	3496.4100
They were in ----
     street	3045.5767
Lady Lucas began directly to calculate with more
interest than the matter had ever excited before, how many years longer

But enough of this	3790.0032
But if I go on, I shall displease you by saying what
I think of persons you esteem	2794.0486
The vicious propensities--the
     want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge
     of his best friend, could not escape the observation of a young man
     of nearly the same age with himself, and who had opportunities of
     seeing him in unguarded moments, which Mr	2508.7052
Bennet could not give her consent, or
speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings,
though she talked to Bingley of nothing else, for half an hour; and when
Mr	2491.6189
org/files/42671/42671-h	10070.3375
Mrs	10116.2240
The respect created by the conviction of his
valuable qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some
time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings; and it was now heightened
into somewhat of a friendlier nature, by the testimony so highly in his
favour, and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light,
which yesterday had produced	2837.5059
CHAPTER XI	8085.8214
The suspicions which had just
arisen of Mr	4795.9412
I am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just
said, and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long	2432.6152
--Elizabeth took leave of
the whole party in the liveliest spirits	1784.2466
"How abominable!--I wonder that the very
pride of this Mr	2369.7558
From the entrance hall, of which Mr	3425.2644
Elizabeth, equally
next to Jane in birth and beauty, succeeded her of course	4332.9344
Darcy should hear the
first raptures of her joy, than the first vehemence of her
disapprobation	2832.7214
To Elizabeth it appeared, that had her family made an agreement to
expose themselves as much as they could during the evening, it would
have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit, or
finer success; and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister
that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice, and that his
feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he
must have witnessed	2192.6699
He was her dear Wickham on every
occasion; no one was to be put in competition with him	3071.4711
She was not sorry, however, to
have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from
whom they sprung	1688.4397
Unfortunately an only son, (for many years an only _child_)
I was spoilt by my parents, who though good themselves, (my father
particularly, all that was benevolent and amiable,) allowed, encouraged,
almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing, to care for none beyond
my own family circle, to think meanly of all the rest of the world, to
_wish_ at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with
my own	3484.4524
But when you have had time to think it all over, I hope you
will be satisfied with what I have done	1119.8619
Of course, we hope that you will support the Project

Bingley's chaise to go to Meryton;
and the Hursts have no horses to theirs	2617.1565
When the gentlemen rose to go away, Mrs	2990.9982
Darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone for those
casual errors, under which she would endeavour to class, what Mr	3995.4579
"

Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to
continue the subject	2313.9965
"

"And of your infliction," cried Elizabeth with energy	1968.7786
"

Jane shook her head	5153.0656
If he is satisfied with only regretting me, when he might
have obtained my affections and hand, I shall soon cease to regret him
at all	2449.8600
We have judged it best, that my
     niece should be married from this house, of which I hope you will
     approve	2144.3311
"He is indeed--but considering the inducement, my dear Miss Eliza, we
cannot wonder at his complaisance; for who would object to such a
partner?"

Elizabeth looked archly, and turned away	1982.3012
I cannot
     understand it	1687.9544
Miss Lucas is married and settled	6505.9510
Elizabeth, as she affectionately embraced her, whilst tears filled the
eyes of both, lost not a moment in asking whether any thing had been
heard of the fugitives	2803.2244
Bennet	10269.3440
Follies
and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies _do_ divert me, I own, and I
laugh at them whenever I can	3095.2429
"I hope," added Mrs	964.1630
She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear
of seeing Mr	2832.5769
"

"May I ask to what these questions tend?"

"Merely to the illustration of _your_ character," said she, endeavouring
to shake off her gravity	2238.4845
--I will only say farther, that
     from what passed that evening, my opinion of all parties was
     confirmed, and every inducement heightened, which could have led me
     before, to preserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy
     connection	2926.9035
"

"And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike
to him, without any reason	3125.7248
Any other inconsistencies with modern spellings have
been left as printed	6797.4875
"

To such perseverance in wilful self-deception Elizabeth would make no
reply, and immediately and in silence withdrew; determined, if he
persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering
encouragement, to apply to her father, whose negative might be uttered
in such a manner as must be decisive, and whose behaviour at least could
not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female	3225.1369
Is this to be endured! But it must not, shall not be	1552.8382
--"Oh! Mr	416.4033
Come as soon as you can on the receipt of
     this	1783.3475
"Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year?"

"Not so much as I could wish, Sir; but I dare say he may spend half his
time here; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months	1513.6358
I will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first
object	1823.3599
Gardiner's business on her arrival, was to
distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions	4851.1438
"And are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real
truth! Oh, that I knew how it was!"

But wishes were vain; or at best could serve only to amuse her in the
hurry and confusion of the following hour	3146.2429
Bingley?"

"Not at all	365.7472
Darcy has no defect	5761.0833
"

"In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of	2828.1483
But we are none
of us consistent; and in his behaviour to me, there were stronger
impulses even than pride	2111.1327
--The younger ones out before the elder are married!--Your
younger sisters must be very young?"

"Yes, my youngest is not sixteen	2581.9706
Bingley," said her husband; "it is a person whom I
never saw in the whole course of my life	945.8375
To be
sure that _did_ seem as if he admired her--indeed I rather believe he
_did_--I heard something about it--but I hardly know what--something
about Mr	3921.0886
She wished
to discredit it entirely, repeatedly exclaiming, "This must be false!
This cannot be! This must be the grossest falsehood!"--and when she had
gone through the whole letter, though scarcely knowing any thing of the
last page or two, put it hastily away, protesting that she would not
regard it, that she would never look in it again	2990.4472
Bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter,
and impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss the
opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible; advice, which there
was every reason to believe would be attended to; and in the clamorous
happiness of Lydia herself in bidding farewell, the more gentle adieus
of her sisters were uttered without being heard	2337.3126
"

"It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come since you will not
visit them	2554.5604
She was ashamed to think how
much	2885.8023
Denny comes back from town	8356.8689
"

"My motive for cautioning you, is as follows	2782.9298
It mortifies me	10204.8865
Mr	10187.8868
They were within twenty yards of each other, and so abrupt was his
appearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight	2279.7402
In this quiet way, the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away	3234.2506
But they are very pleasing women when you
converse with them	3961.1675
"

"This is the consequence you see, Madam, of marrying a daughter," said
Elizabeth	1695.7082
You are
not well enough;--you cannot go yourself	1818.5968
I wish you had been there	1921.7254
"

"Mr	2838.7048
"Oh! my dear Lydia," she cried, "when shall we meet again?"

"Oh, lord! I don't know	244.3104
But at length, by Elizabeth's persuasion,
he was prevailed on to overlook the offence, and seek a reconciliation;
and, after a little farther resistance on the part of his aunt, her
resentment gave way, either to her affection for him, or her curiosity
to see how his wife conducted herself; and she condescended to wait on
them at Pemberley, in spite of that pollution which its woods had
received, not merely from the presence of such a mistress, but the
visits of her uncle and aunt from the city	1991.4944
His father, Miss Bennet, the late Mr	1365.3877
She talked on, therefore, without interruption from any of them till
they were joined by Mr	2276.9088
Forster, and the probability of her being yet more
imprudent with such a companion at Brighton, where the temptations must
be greater than at home	2487.8383
"

"You appear to me, Mr	1494.2419
"

Elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied, "Yes, you know enough of
my _frankness_ to believe me capable of _that_	2240.4708
He was most highly esteemed by Mr	4668.9858
"There is a gentleman with him, mamma," said Kitty; "who can it be?"

"Some acquaintance or other, my dear, I suppose; I am sure I do not
know	1255.2942
He added, that Mr	1946.1436
Mr	10187.8868
"Oh! dear, yes;--but you must own she is very plain	244.3104
"

"Oh! no--it is not for _me_ to be driven away by Mr	324.4310
1	10092.9332
It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life	5529.8612
Darcy, and Mr	681.9020
It is a nice long walk, and Mr	1706.0112
Mrs	10116.2240
Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade
in Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune and risen to the
honour of knighthood by an address to the King, during his mayoralty	3233.2439
"

"There is, I believe, in every disposition a tendency to some particular
evil, a natural defect, which not even the best education can overcome	3152.7968
"Good gracious! Lord bless me! only think! dear me! Mr	1311.3207
Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below	6539.7553
Bingley himself, Elizabeth withdrew
to Miss Lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last
partner she had scarcely replied, before Mr	3333.7262
She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet's height, or
rather taller	3826.6831
Let me take it
in the best light, in the light in which it may be understood	1858.3641
Mrs	10116.2240
"

And when her sisters abused it as ugly, she added, with perfect
unconcern, "Oh! but there were two or three much uglier in the shop; and
when I have bought some prettier-coloured satin to trim it with fresh, I
think it will be very tolerable	1483.7289
His air was grave and
stately, and his manners were very formal	3539.4658
Darcy himself; but,
whenever she did catch a glimpse, she saw an expression of general
complaisance, and in all that he said, she heard an accent so far
removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions, as convinced her that
the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed, however
temporary its existence might prove, had at least outlived one day	2705.1438
At least, therefore, I did not assume the character of needless
precipitance merely to shew off before the ladies	3200.6224
"And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother?" said Mr	1306.4100
"

She burst into tears as she alluded to it, and for a few minutes could
not speak another word	2001.8987
Her manners were
pronounced to be very bad indeed, a mixture of pride and impertinence;
she had no conversation, no style, no taste, no beauty	2865.6352
No sentiment of shame gave a damp to her
triumph	5750.7567
1	10092.9332
"

"You may depend upon my not mentioning it	2742.0200
This event had at last been despaired of, but it was then too
late to be saving	2753.8061
Lady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeth's performance, mixing
with them many instructions on execution and taste	6095.3551
"

"I _did_ hear, too, that there was a time, when sermon-making was not so
palatable to you as it seems to be at present; that you actually
declared your resolution of never taking orders, and that the business
had been compromised accordingly	1945.7008
I knew you would be wishing me joy	3412.4755
Our poor mother
     is sadly grieved	7926.8831
--If, in the explanation of them which is
     due to myself, I am under the necessity of relating feelings which
     may be offensive to your's, I can only say that I am sorry	1814.2530
He was too happy, however, to need much attention;
and luckily for the others, the business of love-making relieved them
from a great deal of his company	1785.7621
I
     take up my pen again to do, what I have just told you I would not,
     but circumstances are such, that I cannot help earnestly begging
     you all to come here, as soon as possible	1824.1792
Hurst or Miss Bingley; and even Lydia was too
much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of "Lord,
how tired I am!" accompanied by a violent yawn	2476.3369
and Mrs	4405.4623
No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you, can
think any thing wanting	3339.8556
"

He then recollected her embarrassment a few days before, on his reading
Mr	3161.6836
Bennet could hardly comprehend
it	6076.0323
&c	10075.0178
On the contrary every particular relative
to his sister, was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself; and
if I endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct, who
will believe me? The general prejudice against Mr	1579.1531
--On this subject I have nothing more
     to say, no other apology to offer	2509.8938
Every thing, however, went on smoothly,
and was finally settled according to Charlotte's first sketch	2526.8861
"

He then shut the door, and coming up to her, claimed the good wishes and
affection of a sister	2562.5666

The sight of
Miss Lucas was odious to her	3356.4339
"

"Yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight	1899.2683
"

"But she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow	2119.3884
She was overpowered by shame and
vexation	5118.4389
Elizabeth, who had expected to find in her as
acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever Mr	3060.7702
--Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the
easiness, openness, ductility of his temper, though no disposition could
offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he never
appeared dissatisfied	3344.8307
Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother	3644.4271
"

Mrs	8806.4321
At such a moment, the arrival of her friend
was a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth, though in the course of their
meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought, when she
saw Mr	1828.7772
Gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing, he asked
her, if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends	1797.4448
The latter was much more
agreeable than his companion expected	4968.2222
Multiple
      superscripted characters are enclosed by curly brackets
      (example: M^{rs})	8411.3723
The darling wish of his
sisters was then gratified; he bought an estate in a neighbouring county
to Derbyshire, and Jane and Elizabeth, in addition to every other source
of happiness, were within thirty miles of each other	2523.3585
Had not my own feelings decided
against you, had they been indifferent, or had they even been
favourable, do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept
the man, who has been the means of ruining, perhaps for ever, the
happiness of a most beloved sister?"

As she pronounced these words, Mr	2445.1800
Bennet withdrew to the library, she saw
Mr	2225.8974
"

"You are over scrupulous surely	2828.0440
Darcy is neither by
honour nor inclination confined to his cousin, why is not he to make
another choice? And if I am that choice, why may not I accept him?"

"Because honour, decorum, prudence, nay, interest, forbid it	3609.6012
She
must own that she was tired of great houses; after going over so many,
she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains	4576.5804
" Some of them were to dine with the Philipses the
next day, and their aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr	1976.8551

Absence had increased her desire of seeing
Charlotte again, and weakened her disgust of Mr	4014.6998
But he had given a reason for his interference, which asked no
extraordinary stretch of belief	3798.1090
"Your affectionate friend,

     "LYDIA BENNET	3651.1274
"

"I have already told her so once, by your desire	2088.5162
"




CHAPTER XVIII	7173.7280
Darcy had to decide on the propriety of
his friend's inclination, or why, upon his own judgment alone, he was to
determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy	2418.1213
--One does not know what to
think	1999.0152
Bennet, offended by his manner of mentioning a
country neighbourhood	3636.7188
Forgive
me; and if you persist in indifference, do not make _me_ your
confidante	2468.8237
"

"Are they indeed?" cried Elizabeth, with the greatest satisfaction	1274.4483
There is nothing else to be done	1487.1390
He leaves out half his words, and blots the rest	4339.1002
She
could not bear such suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper,
wrote a short letter to her aunt, to request an explanation of what
Lydia had dropt, if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been
intended	2806.2512
I have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment	1519.2106
--His
     sisters' uneasiness had been equally excited with my own; our
     coincidence of feeling was soon discovered; and, alike sensible
     that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother, we shortly
     resolved on joining him directly in London	3905.6312
Mrs	10116.2240
Collins's scruples of leaving Mr	6646.9267
--I
think it no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements	4158.7354
The marriage of a daughter, which had been the first object of
her wishes, since Jane was sixteen, was now on the point of
accomplishment, and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those
attendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new carriages, and
servants	2410.7657
Mrs	10116.2240
In the dining-room they were soon joined by Mary and Kitty, who had been
too busily engaged in their separate apartments, to make their
appearance before	2711.5750
Oh, brother,
how kind you are! I know you will contrive it all	2049.7595
You need not	4333.7664
But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness, is a most
natural consequence of the prejudices I had been encouraging	2684.0383
I am not indebted for my present happiness to
your eager desire of expressing your gratitude	3829.2669
Darcy might have done as well	2220.5736
"

Elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those
in the room	2658.4352
--Elizabeth could but just _affect_ concern in
missing him; she really rejoiced at it	5238.9115
It would look odd to be
entirely silent for half an hour together, and yet for the advantage of
_some_, conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the
trouble of saying as little as possible	2527.0987
"

Elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character, but said
nothing	2190.1439
Wickham was as far beyond them all in person, countenance, air, and
walk, as _they_ were superior to the broad-faced stuffy uncle Philips,
breathing port wine, who followed them into the room	3240.7217
Bingley before, expressed to her sister how very much
she admired him	3776.7502
On distinguishing the ladies of the group,
the two gentlemen came directly towards them, and began the usual
civilities	2453.5113
intending to trace their route	7385.3936
"FITZWILLIAM DARCY	10519.0230
Their taking her home, and affording her their personal
protection and countenance, is such a sacrifice to her advantage, as
years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge	3339.1075
--They had several children	6875.0130
I was very
uncomfortable, I may say unhappy	2473.7413
Gardiner left them soon after breakfast	4277.7173
"

Mr	8837.5692
How much you
must have gone through!"

Her sister, however, assured her, of her being perfectly well; and their
conversation, which had been passing while Mr	1344.3860
Darcy appeared again, when,
looking at him, she was a little relieved by his smile	1662.6860
The whole family in short
were properly overjoyed on the occasion	4432.5423
They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to
have their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little as
possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your
life	3096.9924
Mrs	10116.2240
She is on her road somewhere, I dare say, and so passing through
Meryton, thought she might as well call on you	2089.0662
"

"I have not a doubt of Mr	1005.1037
Collins has made
you an offer of marriage	4509.4430
He then sat down by her, and talked scarcely to any one else	1748.3959
She was engaged one day as she walked, in re-perusing Jane's last
letter, and dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane had not
written in spirits, when, instead of being again surprised by Mr	2825.3522
Collins well	10182.1333
Bennet's sour looks and ill-natured remarks might have been
enough to drive happiness away	4124.9026
You must and shall be married by a special licence	3644.3439
No motive can
excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted _there_	10141.1519
"

"Yes, vanity is a weakness indeed	2744.2810
"

"It is evident by this," added Jane, "that he comes back no more this
winter	1599.0335
Mr	10187.8868
Lord!
how I should like to be married before any of you; and then I would
chaperon you about to all the balls	474.6660
But she had no reason to fear Mr	2183.0662
It cannot last long	3818.5067
"Now," said she, "that this first meeting is over, I feel perfectly
easy	1712.9119
You know not what you are
about	2620.9309
I am afraid you will not be able to make
     it out, but I hardly know what I have written	862.6778
The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work	3278.1645
You shewed me how insufficient were all my
pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased	5018.7659
But who was your mother? Who
are your uncles and aunts? Do not imagine me ignorant of their
condition	2507.6457
Bennet's visit, and sat about ten
minutes with him in his library	1996.9057
"

He should be particularly happy at any time, &c	3716.4088
"I admire all my three sons-in-law highly," said he	2095.1517
They
ran through the vestibule into the breakfast room; from thence to the
library;--their father was in neither; and they were on the point of
seeking him up stairs with their mother, when they were met by the
butler, who said,

"If you are looking for my master, ma'am, he is walking towards the
little copse	2368.8897
It was an
encouragement of vice; and had I been the rector of Longbourn, I should
very strenuously have opposed it	3076.7923
Wickham, we are brother and sister, you know	1599.4286
"

"I know you do; and it is _that_ which makes the wonder	1952.3714
Miss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any
extenuating circumstances in the case, unknown to the society of
Hertfordshire; her mild and steady candour always pleaded for
allowances, and urged the possibility of mistakes--but by everybody else
Mr	3763.6041
Kitty, run down and order the carriage	5241.3568
Collins; and whatever might be his feelings towards her
friend, met her with every appearance of composure	2664.1053
Bennet half opened the door and called out,

"Lizzy, my dear, I want to speak with you	1586.1314
The
wish of procuring her regard, which she had assured herself of his
feeling in Derbyshire, could not in rational expectation survive such a
blow as this	2737.9852
" She then sought her eldest sister, who had undertaken to make
inquiries on the same subject of Bingley	2414.8004
Gardiner, though seldom able to indulge the
taste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much engaged in watching the
occasional appearance of some trout in the water, and talking to the man
about them, that he advanced but little	1979.5374

Foundation's web site and official page at www	6052.6115
Wickham	10188.6530
At such an assembly as this, it
would be insupportable	2034.1536
Bingley
was obliged to be in town the following day, and consequently unable to
accept the honour of their invitation, &c	1739.6675
Darcy	10318.3165
Not a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till their
visitor took his leave for the night; but as soon as he was gone, he
turned to his daughter and said,

"Jane, I congratulate you	1747.6320
He
must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found
her	2821.1323
So near
a vicinity to her mother and Meryton relations was not desirable even to
_his_ easy temper, or _her_ affectionate heart	4260.7304
I believe him to be Lady Catherine's _nephew_	1322.2742
Neither had any thing occurred in the intelligence of
their Lambton friends, that could materially lessen its weight	2957.5402
Elizabeth felt Jane's
pleasure	6545.7633
Collins should be in possession of the
Longbourn estate, it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife
should make their appearance at St	2753.8654
CHAPTER III	6939.7433
But
my dearest love, tell me what dish Mr	5047.1669
"What can be the meaning of this!" said Charlotte, as soon as he was
gone	1013.9695
She dreaded seeing Wickham again,
and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible	2256.2066
They had often attempted it before, but it was a subject on which Mrs	2023.5288
Darcy replied with great intrepidity,

"Miss Elizabeth Bennet	3208.1824
They have
known her much longer than they have known me; no wonder if they love
her better	5714.3208
Colonel Forster came yesterday, having left Brighton the day
     before, not many hours after the express	3512.6072
"

They were all astonished; and Mr	2152.0174
Hurst and Miss Bingley, they were noticed only by a curtsey; and
on their being seated, a pause, awkward as such pauses must always be,
succeeded for a few moments	2535.7147
We _will_ know where
we have gone--we _will_ recollect what we have seen	5148.1361
He only meant that there were not
such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town, which
you must acknowledge to be true	1918.0515
"

"You persist, then, in supposing his sisters influence him	3158.0570
I thought I should have died	2521.8852
--Mr	5796.4762
Mrs	10116.2240
In every thing else she is as
good natured a girl as ever lived	3942.7030
"

Miss Bennet still looked all amazement	4252.3111
Will you be very angry with me, my dear
     Lizzy, if I take this opportunity of saying (what I was never bold
     enough to say before) how much I like him	2277.4247
Mrs	10116.2240
"

"We are speaking of music, Madam," said he, when no longer able to avoid
a reply	1876.1806
Bennet could certainly
spare you for another fortnight	7103.1872
Mr	10187.8868
"

"Pride," observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of her
reflections, "is a very common failing I believe	2446.1351
--Here you are in your own family	3052.1109
Wickham	10188.6530
It could not be for society, as he frequently sat there
ten minutes together without opening his lips; and when he did speak, it
seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice--a sacrifice to
propriety, not a pleasure to himself	3384.3864
Mrs	10116.2240
"

Elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal; yet
was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an
epithet	3740.5008
Her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined	3382.6848
He
then said,

"I have received a letter this morning that has astonished me
exceedingly	2694.5359
"

"To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of
either	3710.8525
"Well, Lizzy," continued her mother soon afterwards, "and so the
Collinses live very comfortable, do they? Well, well, I only hope it
will last	1823.2620
Collins too!--Why should _he_ have it more than anybody else?"

"I leave it to yourself to determine," said Mr	2420.9575
Bingley did
not do justice to his own disposition	1988.8070
They will then join his regiment,
     unless they are first invited to Longbourn; and I understand from
     Mrs	3475.1087
Hurst, "in running away
without telling us that you were coming out	3773.8420
Nothing, on the contrary, could be more natural; and while able to
suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her, she was
ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both, and could very
sincerely wish him happy	2669.4234
Darcy
returned within the stated time	7474.2013
They had frequently been staying with her in town	3270.6489
--Without thinking highly
either of men or of matrimony, marriage had always been her object; it
was the only honourable provision for well-educated young women of small
fortune, and however uncertain of giving happiness, must be their
pleasantest preservative from want	4500.4290
--The
     necessity must be obeyed--and farther apology would be absurd	4294.9307
It had better have happened to _you_, Lizzy; you
would have laughed yourself out of it sooner	2859.8416
I am not ashamed of having been
mistaken--or, at least, it is slight, it is nothing in comparison of
what I should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters	1972.4886
To Kitty, however, it does not
     seem so wholly unexpected	2125.0215
Darcy only can answer	6821.0395
They are not married,
     nor can I find there was any intention of being so; but if you are
     willing to perform the engagements which I have ventured to make on
     your side, I hope it will not be long before they are	1896.1972
He may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my
acquaintance, but that is all	2228.3250
With amazement did
she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power;
and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to
give, which a just sense of shame would not conceal	2501.5800
You must
give me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the compliment of
believing what I say	2867.7938
But little had she dared
to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there	5423.6965
For a few moments, indeed,
she felt that he would probably strike into some other path	2136.6115
"You certainly do," she replied with a smile; "but it does not follow
that the interruption must be unwelcome	1915.7757
At our time of life, it is not so
pleasant I can tell you, to be making new acquaintance every day; but
for your sakes, we would do any thing	2096.0255
Wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled, a
doubt of his being present had never occurred to her	3710.8939
Had they fixed on any other man
it would have been nothing; but _his_ perfect indifference, and _your_
pointed dislike, make it so delightfully absurd! Much as I abominate
writing, I would not give up Mr	2588.2633
They
entered it in one of its lowest points, and drove for some time through
a beautiful wood, stretching over a wide extent	4700.0936
Sometimes she could fancy, that he talked less than on
former occasions, and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that
as he looked at her, he was trying to trace a resemblance	2409.4004
They insist also on
     my seeing Mr	7353.7101
"When is your next ball to be, Lizzy?"

"To-morrow fortnight	1298.6119
"

In vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable, and Jane to make

Girls, can I do any
thing for you in Meryton? Oh! here comes Hill	1717.1438
"I will go to Meryton," said she, "as soon as I am dressed, and tell the
good, good news to my sister Philips	1172.8315
Collins's picture of Hunsford and
Rosings rationally softened; and Elizabeth perceived that she must wait
for her own visit there, to know the rest	2343.7582
"

Elizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at Mr	2417.8167
I now give it to _you_, if you are resolved on
having him	2806.8358
"

"It is no such thing	1490.1865
She talked to Elizabeth again and again;
coaxed and threatened her by turns	5596.0215
Her favourite walk, and where
she frequently went while the others were calling on Lady Catherine, was
along the open grove which edged that side of the park, where there was
a nice sheltered path, which no one seemed to value but herself, and
where she felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherine's curiosity	2580.8342
The business of her life was to get her
daughters married; its solace was visiting and news	4061.2709
That had
his actions been what Wickham represented them, so gross a violation of
every thing right could hardly have been concealed from the world; and
that friendship between a person capable of it, and such an amiable man
as Mr	2599.3577
This is the last time I shall ever
remember it myself	3091.8735
He could even
listen to Sir William Lucas, when he complimented him on carrying away
the brightest jewel of the country, and expressed his hopes of their all
meeting frequently at St	3233.8167
Darcy chose to doubt it--or to treat it as a merely
conditional recommendation, and to assert that I had forfeited all claim
to it by extravagance, imprudence, in short any thing or nothing	3820.0060
--Not that I have much pleasure indeed in
talking to any body	2875.8746
"It
seems likely to have been a desirable match for Jane," said she	1277.4860
Her coming there was the most unfortunate, the most ill-judged
thing in the world! How strange must it appear to him! In what a
disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man! It might seem as if
she had purposely thrown herself in his way again! Oh! why did she come?
or, why did he thus come a day before he was expected? Had they been
only ten minutes sooner, they should have been beyond the reach of his
discrimination, for it was plain that he was that moment arrived, that
moment alighted from his horse or his carriage	1519.9634

It is very unlucky; but as I have actually paid the visit, we

"About a month ago I received this letter, and about a fortnight ago I
answered it, for I thought it a case of some delicacy, and requiring
early attention	3015.4757
Collins was at leisure to look around him and admire, and he was so much
struck with the size and furniture of the apartment, that he declared he
might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour
at Rosings; a comparison that did not at first convey much
gratification; but when Mrs	2540.1161

unhappy	3460.2053
What he told me was merely this; that he congratulated himself
on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most
imprudent marriage, but without mentioning names or any other
particulars, and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing him
the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort, and from
knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer	2760.3398
"

Miss Bingley's congratulations to her brother, on his approaching
marriage, were all that was affectionate and insincere	1893.9639
Mr	10187.8868

Gardiner; and after relating the
circumstances, she thus went on:--"I am now convinced, my dear aunt,
that I have never been much in love; for had I really experienced that
pure and elevating passion, I should at present detest his very name,

Collins,

With the Gardiners, they were always on the most intimate terms	2515.8878
She turned from sister to sister, demanding their
congratulations, and when at length they all sat down, looked eagerly
round the room, took notice of some little alteration in it, and
observed, with a laugh, that it was a great while since she had been
there	2048.3230

"Miss Elizabeth Bennet!" repeated Miss Bingley	904.7685
This preservative she had now
obtained; and at the age of twenty-seven, without having ever been
handsome, she felt all the good luck of it	2389.7354
--Elizabeth accepted their company, and the three young ladies set
off together	2497.4919
He
found her as handsome as she had been last year; as good natured, and as
unaffected, though not quite so chatty	2481.9377
In revolving lady Catherine's expressions, however, she could not help
feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting
in this interference	2004.7990
Philips
protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery
tickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards	3381.3319
"There has
been many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way	2512.8337

it is not true	1833.4261
--Wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of
     my youth, the acknowledged favourite of my father, a young man who
     had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage, and who
     had been brought up to expect its exertion, would be a depravity,
     to which the separation of two young persons, whose affection could
     be the growth of only a few weeks, could bear no comparison	2935.7012
If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy	3231.3107
Between Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept them
mutually silent on the subject; and Elizabeth felt persuaded that no
real confidence could ever subsist between them again	3273.1471
"Lizzy is
only headstrong in such matters as these	4743.5616
Mrs	10116.2240

that in point of true beauty, Miss De Bourgh is far superior to the
handsomest of her sex; because there is that in her features which marks
the young woman of distinguished birth	3379.9299

Elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference for
her authority proceeded; but it was not in her power to give any
information of so satisfactory a nature, as the compliment deserved	2367.3810

     say, there will be some little money, even when all his debts are
     discharged, to settle on my niece, in addition to her own fortune	2162.4413
Bennet could not have chosen
better	2247.0184

"And if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he has at least
great pleasure in the power of choice	2100.3236
Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of
Mr	1787.0441
Well, he certainly is
very agreeable, and I give you leave to like him	1869.5155
"And they are really to be married!" cried Elizabeth, as soon as they
were by themselves	952.1769
They went to the library,
therefore, and asked their father, whether he would not wish them to
make it known to her	1443.3850
"

"Go, my dear," cried her mother, "and shew her ladyship about the
different walks	1580.2697
She has been doing
every thing in her power by thinking and talking on the subject, to give
greater--what shall I call it? susceptibility to her feelings; which are
naturally lively enough	2176.2642

Mr	10187.8868
Seriously, I would have you be on your guard	1919.6422
Here are officers enough at
Meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country	3009.7076
But
this idea was soon banished, and her spirits were very differently
affected, when, to her utter amazement, she saw Mr	2470.4359
Not one party, or scheme, or any thing	2030.2162
"

"But does Lydia know nothing of this? Can she be ignorant of what you
and Jane seem so well to understand?"

"Oh, yes!--that, that is the worst of all	1783.0271
That she should receive an offer of
marriage from Mr	4336.9067
--The last born has as good a right to the pleasures of
youth, as the first	3310.1270
My reproofs at Hunsford could not
work such a change as this	3584.5650
After breakfast, the girls walked to Meryton to inquire if Mr	4811.7089
"He is just what a young man ought to be," said she, "sensible, good
humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners!--so much ease,
with such perfect good breeding!"

"He is also handsome," replied Elizabeth, "which a young man ought
likewise to be, if he possibly can	1510.1150
I was not in a humour to
wait for any opening of your's	2053.2190
"--And
upon Elizabeth's seeming really, with vexed and embarrassed looks, about
to escape, she added, "Lizzy, I _insist_ upon your staying and hearing
Mr	3675.5655

another very welcome surprise; for his chief wish at present, was to
have as little trouble in the business as possible	2286.3904

Bennet, to whom they then turned, was not quite
so cordial	2062.9508

The gentlemen arrived early; and, before Mrs	2794.2105
His behaviour to her sister was such, during dinner time, as shewed an
admiration of her, which, though more guarded than formerly, persuaded
Elizabeth, that if left wholly to himself, Jane's happiness, and his
own, would be speedily secured	1924.7477
Bennet sat looking and winking at
Elizabeth and Catherine for a considerable time, without making any
impression on them	4551.7457
Bennet, in short, was in very great spirits; she had seen enough of
Bingley's behaviour to Jane, to be convinced that she would get him at
last; and her expectations of advantage to her family, when in a happy
humour, were so far beyond reason, that she was quite disappointed at
not seeing him there again the next day, to make his proposals	1587.2946
and Mrs	4405.4623
They were off Saturday night about twelve, as
     is conjectured, but were not missed till yesterday morning at
     eight	4662.7516

conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them,
without actual blame on either side	3528.0707

acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself	3828.9331
There was too much to
be thought; and felt, and said, for attention to any other objects	1214.9709
Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of
passing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and was too
much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas
was his neighbour, till Sir William thus began	2765.6767
"I have been thinking it over again, Elizabeth," said her uncle, as they
drove from the town; "and really, upon serious consideration, I am much
more inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does of the
matter	1622.3407
F	10070.3375
But his anger, I am persuaded, lasted no longer than he remained
in any doubt of your sister's sentiments	2824.9696

opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind	2905.2442

saying something that might turn her mother's thoughts, now asked her if
Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since _her_ coming away	2908.5480
The Lucases are very artful people indeed,
sister	5473.4562
Bingley, and the
train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to,
made her perhaps almost as happy as Jane	3440.4366

     surprise the greater, when I write to them, and sign my name Lydia

Gardiner, "there is no absolute proof
that they are not gone to Scotland	1996.2465

"You are very cruel," said her sister, "you will not let me smile, and
are provoking me to it every moment	1233.0198
"

"Well, then, you need not be under any alarm	2077.8625
Its completion depended on others	9296.7403

Lydia were far from envying Miss Lucas, for Mr	2808.4899

upstart pretensions of a young woman without family, connections, or
fortune	2636.5879

be able to do so	1607.3976

over that gravel walk	2594.5575

journey, and brought its master back to Longbourn	3226.4535
In the first place, she persisted in disbelieving
the whole of the matter; secondly, she was very sure that Mr	1966.8930
She does not yet leave her dressing-room	3779.9392
He was growing quite
inattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by her	3436.7257
And yet, upon my honour, I
believed what I said of myself to be true, and I believe it at this
moment	2031.3642
Collins
received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure, and then
proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview, with the result
of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied, since the
refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow
from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character	3206.1380
The feelings
of the person who wrote, and the person who received it, are now so
widely different from what they were then, that every unpleasant
circumstance attending it, ought to be forgotten	2249.5495
Not these two or three years perhaps	5052.2220
Now be sincere;
did you admire me for my impertinence?"

"For the liveliness of your mind, I did	3049.6856
She could neither
wonder nor condemn, but the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing
consolatory to her bosom, afforded no palliation of her distress	3937.2485
Miss Bingley's civility to Elizabeth increased at last
very rapidly, as well as her affection for Jane; and when they parted,
after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to
see her either at Longbourn or Netherfield, and embracing her most
tenderly, she even shook hands with the former	2115.6764
When convinced on that article, Miss Bennet had nothing
farther to wish	3676.3957
His character was decided	5309.6059
The park was very large, and contained great variety of ground	3627.8604
are
sufficiently known	10151.9513
She accounted for it, however, by supposing that
her last letter to her friend from Longbourn, had by some accident been
lost	2304.2937
"

"Your list of the common extent of accomplishments," said Darcy, "has
too much truth	1779.5176
A small sum could not do all this	2926.4699
Hope was over, entirely over; and when Jane could attend to the rest of
the letter, she found little, except the professed affection of the
writer, that could give her any comfort	2193.8963
But I believe your opinion of him would in general
astonish--and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly
anywhere else	3068.1374
Bingley was the principal spokesman, and Miss Bennet the
principal object	1788.1875
And their
mother had the satisfaction of knowing, that she should be able to shew
her married daughter in the neighbourhood, before she was banished to
the North	1908.5128
I shall never be quite happy till I
     have been all round the park	2293.7415
"

"You did! and it was not wholly without foundation	1122.6162
But Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every prospect
of her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not dwell long on her
spirits; and having told all her griefs to Charlotte Lucas, whom she had
not seen for a week, she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to
the oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her particular
notice	1896.1937
Bingley called again, and alone	2204.9825
Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners were very much admired at the parsonage,
and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of
their engagements at Rosings	1903.4621
Lakes, mountains,
and rivers, shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations; nor, when
we attempt to describe any particular scene, will we begin quarrelling
about its relative situation	4949.8470
You have delighted us long enough	5083.0982
"

He then told her of Georgiana's delight in her acquaintance, and of her
disappointment at its sudden interruption; which naturally leading to
the cause of that interruption, she soon learnt that his resolution of
following her from Derbyshire in quest of her sister, had been formed
before he quitted the inn, and that his gravity and thoughtfulness
there, had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must
comprehend	2776.9424
I was uncomfortable enough	4178.5724
She asked her at different times, how many sisters
she had, whether they were older or younger than herself, whether any of
them were likely to be married, whether they were handsome, where they
had been educated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been her
mother's maiden name?--Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her
questions, but answered them very composedly	2453.4017
"Of music! Then pray speak aloud	2411.7981
But it ought to
be done, and if you will give me a sheet of paper, it shall be done
directly	1497.2644
"

"That is very true," replied Elizabeth, "and I could easily forgive
_his_ pride, if he had not mortified _mine_	1242.4380
Egerton,
Military Library, Whitehall	6435.2585
There--I have saved you the trouble of accounting for it;
and really, all things considered, I begin to think it perfectly
reasonable	2420.2207
They crossed it by a simple bridge, in character with the general air of
the scene; it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited; and
the valley, here contracted into a glen, allowed room only for the
stream, and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered
it	3538.0818
I hope I never ridicule what is wise or good	4393.4526
"

Elizabeth's spirits were so high on the occasion, that though she did
not often speak unnecessarily to Mr	2271.5654
Gardiner could do	4569.3344
Darcy took up a book; Miss Bingley did the same;
and Mrs	2898.0606
It amazes
me, I confess;--for certainly, there can be nothing so advantageous to
them as instruction	2998.5187
Amongst the most violent against him was Mrs	6190.2009
Collins to join his daughters in their
walk; and Mr	3086.5262
To Jane, he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused, and
whose merit she had undervalued; but to her own more extensive
information, he was the person, to whom the whole family were indebted
for the first of benefits, and whom she regarded herself with an
interest, if not quite so tender, at least as reasonable and just, as
what Jane felt for Bingley	2241.3388
Darcy
had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance	5574.7951
--But I tell you what, Miss Lizzy, if you take
it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way,
you will never get a husband at all--and I am sure I do not know who is
to maintain you when your father is dead	2204.5135
Her affections had been continually
fluctuating, but never without an object	4067.0034

Hurst sang with her sister, and while they were thus employed
Elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some music books
that lay on the instrument, how frequently Mr	2719.8319

But the gloom of Lydia's prospect was shortly cleared away; for she
received an invitation from Mrs	4183.3120
Darcy corroborated it with a bow, and
was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on Elizabeth, when they
were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger, and Elizabeth
happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other,
was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting	1958.5276
--But their
father, though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure, was really
glad to see them; he had felt their importance in the family circle	2034.4251
Darcy rise also and follow him, and her agitation on seeing it was
extreme	2828.6954
The
liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value!"

She was now, on being settled at home, at leisure to observe the real
state of her sister's spirits	2927.1665
It was, moreover, such a promising thing for her younger
daughters, as Jane's marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of
other rich men; and lastly, it was so pleasant at her time of life to be
able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister, that
she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked	2070.5133

You supposed more than
     really existed	5896.3942

As to
his real character, had information been in her power, she had never
felt a wish of enquiring	1905.6195
Every day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety; but the most anxious
part of each was when the post was expected	2886.7476
The old lady is Mrs	9357.9014
"

"We will be down as soon as we can," said Jane; "but I dare say Kitty is
forwarder than either of us, for she went up stairs half an hour ago	1841.5769
I wish I could see her	2199.6929
She had not at first thought very seriously of
going thither; but Charlotte, she soon found, was depending on the plan,
and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure
as well as greater certainty	2578.7442
She felt anew the justice of Mr	6180.8339
"It must not be thought of	1870.2272
"

"Is my father in town?"

"Yes, he went on Tuesday as I wrote you word	1270.0098
Darcy's character, though he had assured her that respect for the
father, would always prevent his exposing the son	2455.5905
Mr	10187.8868
They agreed that Mrs	7727.0657
Collins listened to her
with the determined air of following his own inclination, and when she
ceased speaking, replied thus,

"My dear Miss Elizabeth, I have the highest opinion in the world of your
excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your
understanding, but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference
between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity, and those
which regulate the clergy; for give me leave to observe that I consider
the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank
in the kingdom--provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the
same time maintained	2814.5221
"

Mr	8837.5692
I shall offer to pay him to-morrow; he will rant and storm about
his love for you, and there will be an end of the matter	2109.5909
She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings,
and had sent for him only the Saturday before, to make up her pool of
quadrille in the evening	2532.1428
At night she opened her heart to Jane	6222.9468
"

"Neither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude," replied Elizabeth, "have any
possible claim on me, in the present instance	1889.4555
"I have an excessive regard for Jane Bennet, she is really a very sweet
girl, and I wish with all my heart she were well settled	1817.7002
I
hope he will overlook it	3943.3245
Good Heaven! Brighton, and a whole
campful of soldiers, to us, who have been overset already by one poor
regiment of militia, and the monthly balls of Meryton	970.8330
They
had nothing to accuse him of but pride; pride he probably had, and if
not, it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small
market-town, where the family did not visit	2937.1829

Does she live near you, sir?"

"The garden in which stands my humble abode, is separated only by a lane
from Rosings Park, her ladyship's residence	2077.3489
'Lady
Catherine,' said she, 'you have given me a treasure	3592.8422
As soon as they were gone, Elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits;
or in other words, to dwell without interruption on those subjects that
must deaden them more	3757.4332
Such were the gentle murmurs of Mrs	6774.9626
Mrs	10116.2240
It is very often nothing but
our own vanity that deceives us	4300.6095
James's, Sir William was so completely
awed, by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had but just courage
enough to make a very low bow, and take his seat without saying a word;
and his daughter, frightened almost out of her senses, sat on the edge
of her chair, not knowing which way to look	2253.5141
"

"How can you contrive to write so even?"

He was silent	2003.5912
However, your coming just at this time is the
greatest of comforts, and I am very glad to hear what you tell us, of
long sleeves	2179.0680
She began at length to recover, to
fidget about in her chair, get up, sit down again, wonder, and bless
herself	3891.8292
"

"_That_ is a failing indeed!"--cried Elizabeth	1310.7434
Their society can afford no pleasure,
that will atone for such wretchedness as this! Let me never see either
one or the other again!"

Yet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer no
compensation, received soon afterwards material relief, from observing
how much the beauty of her sister re-kindled the admiration of her
former lover	3249.1381

smiled, looked handsome, and said many pretty things	3629.8889

behind you; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before the
winter is over	2449.5933
You
may have drawn him in	3578.6430
She was quite amazed
at her own discomposure; but amongst other causes of disquiet, she
dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in
her favour; and more than commonly anxious to please, she naturally
suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her	3071.0572
"

"If you mean Darcy," cried her brother, "he may go to bed, if he chuses,
before it begins--but as for the ball, it is quite a settled thing; and
as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough I shall send round my
cards	2099.0792
"

Elizabeth looked at Darcy to see how cordially he assented to his
cousin's praise; but neither at that moment nor at any other could she
discern any symptom of love; and from the whole of his behaviour to Miss
De Bourgh she derived this comfort for Miss Bingley, that he might have
been just as likely to marry _her_, had she been his relation	2176.0369
I promised
them so faithfully! What will Wickham say? It was to be such a secret!"

"If it was to be secret," said Jane, "say not another word on the
subject	4023.1571
But let me advise you to think better of it	2676.7594
Darcy was really the
object of her choice, by explaining the gradual change which her
estimation of him had undergone, relating her absolute certainty that
his affection was not the work of a day, but had stood the test of many
months suspense, and enumerating with energy all his good qualities, she
did conquer her father's incredulity, and reconcile him to the match	2897.7911
"

"Oh! where, where is my uncle?" cried Elizabeth, darting from her seat
as she finished the letter, in eagerness to follow him, without losing a
moment of the time so precious; but as she reached the door, it was
opened by a servant, and Mr	324.4310
E	10070.3375
"Yes, she called yesterday with her father	1620.4856
She felt it so; and though, in
looking forward, neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity,
could be justly expected for her sister; in looking back to what they
had feared, only two hours ago, she felt all the advantages of what they
had gained	2833.4078
"

Mr	8837.5692
"

Elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt persuaded
of her sister's ready acquiescence	2286.4833
She cared for none
     of her friends, she wanted no help of his, she would not hear of
     leaving Wickham	2125.9585
"

"Kitty has no discretion in her coughs," said her father; "she times
them ill	2681.5414
Bennet's eyes sparkled with pleasure, and she was
eagerly calling out, while her daughter read,

Jane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love	1484.4875

He had been some days in town, before he was able to
     discover them; but he had something to direct his search, which was
     more than _we_ had; and the consciousness of this, was another
     reason for his resolving to follow us	1881.6084

mile behind	3438.0390

other table	2585.4703
Bingley's large fortune, the mention of which gave animation to their
mother, was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of
an ensign	3162.4045
"

"Upon my word, Sir," cried Elizabeth, "your hope is rather an
extraordinary one after my declaration	2601.3665
The
happiness which this reply produced, was such as he had probably never
felt before; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as
warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do	2758.8226
Darcy, only for a few minutes to take
leave, but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least
an hour, hoping for her return, and almost resolving to walk after her
till she could be found	1946.0135
"

It was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now	3502.3651
You have sense, and we all
expect you to use it	3232.4468
Let us hope, therefore, that her being
there may teach her her own insignificance	2414.2475
Bingley and Jane were standing together, a little detached from the
rest, and talked only to each other	2019.2365
Wickham was to
     the last so steady, that in his will he particularly recommended it
     to me, to promote his advancement in the best manner that his
     profession might allow, and if he took orders, desired that a
     valuable family living might be his as soon as soon as it became
     vacant	2402.5344
The supposition did not pain her	4896.4597
Darcy with grave propriety requested to be allowed the honour of her
hand; but in vain	2575.0279
Darcy's letter, nor explain to her sister how sincerely she
had been valued by his friend	1768.4626

"Is this a hint to me, Lizzy," said her father, "to send for the
horses?"

"No, indeed	970.0554
My aunt told me so
herself on Saturday	4940.5870
They were confined for the evening at different tables, and she had
nothing to hope, but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side
of the room, as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself	1559.0409

back	1899.4627

"We shall often meet, I hope, in Hertfordshire	1373.6400

"I beg your pardon," replied Miss Bingley, turning away with a sneer	1524.1053
Mr	10187.8868
Miss Darcy looked as if she
wished for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes did venture a
short sentence, when there was least danger of its being heard	2387.2403
"

Mrs	8806.4321
Mrs	10116.2240
While the contents of the first
letter remained on her mind, she was all surprise--all astonishment that
Wickham should marry a girl, whom it was impossible he could marry for
money; and how Lydia could ever have attached him, had appeared
incomprehensible	2995.4342
A military life is not what I was intended for, but circumstances have
now made it eligible	3334.4968
Is not it so, Mrs	3942.4755
His behaviour to us has,
     in every respect, been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire	3302.1484
Bingley and his sisters came to give their
personal invitation for the long expected ball at Netherfield, which was
fixed for the following Tuesday	2399.1380
When I last saw her, she was not very promising	1536.3775
Having now a good house and very sufficient income, he intended to
marry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn family he had
a wife in view, as he meant to chuse one of the daughters, if he found
them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report	2602.8497
Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject; and
affectionately taking her hand, said in reply,

"Do not make yourself uneasy, my love	2290.1825
It is a pity they are not handsome! Not that _I_ think
Charlotte so _very_ plain--but then she is our particular friend	1200.7847
"

"You have only proved by this," cried Elizabeth, "that Mr	1234.0329
She was
sorry that Mr	3952.4437
"Well, mamma," said she, when they were all returned to the breakfast
room, "and what do you think of my husband? Is not he a charming man? I
am sure my sisters must all envy me	1045.8692
Collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had passed	3885.1070
He repeated the question, with some
surprise at her silence	3696.8661
--Many
stared	8826.5511
" She then sat still five
minutes longer; but unable to waste such a precious occasion, she
suddenly got up, and saying to Kitty,

"Come here, my love, I want to speak to you," took her out of the room	1834.2743
Jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the
society of her two friends, and the attentions of their brother; and
Elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr	2005.5234
Not like the wild young men now-a-days, who think of nothing but
themselves	4426.1071
The justice of the charge struck her too forcibly
for denial, and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded, as
having passed at the Netherfield ball, and as confirming all his first
disapprobation, could not have made a stronger impression on his mind
than on hers	2650.0088
9	10070.3375
The next was in these words	3794.2983
Jane resolutely
kept her place at the table; but Elizabeth, to satisfy her mother, went
to the window--she looked,--she saw Mr	2248.2635

No one made any reply	5135.4203

editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U	5183.0891
Miss Bingley offered her the carriage, and she only
wanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane testified such concern
in parting with her, that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer
of the chaise into an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the
present	2089.2028
Wickham has created, a
     suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his
     real character	5198.9378
Ignorant as you previously were of every thing
     concerning either, detection could not be in your power, and
     suspicion certainly not in your inclination	2519.4825
It was consequently necessary to
name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity; to have
some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed, and by
again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation, console herself for the
present, and prepare for another disappointment	3490.9170
With such rivals for the notice of the fair, as Mr	2700.1236
Nobody can tell what I
suffer!--But it is always so	2623.4132

above them all! If I could but see _you_ as happy! If there _were_ but
such another man for you!"

"If you were to give me forty such men, I never could be so happy as
you	244.3104
Collins and myself on
this happy event, let me now add a short hint on the subject of another:
of which we have been advertised by the same authority	3032.6097
Her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in
her way	4401.0184
"

With such kind of histories of their parties and good jokes, did Lydia,
assisted by Kitty's hints and additions, endeavour to amuse her
companions all the way to Longbourn	4823.7887
"

"And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry? Did he know of
their intending to go off? Had Colonel Forster seen Denny himself?"

"Yes; but when questioned by _him_ Denny denied knowing any thing of
their plan, and would not give his real opinion about it	2296.5332
"He must be an oddity, I think," said she	1149.1330
She is quite a little
creature	2629.6519
He was struggling for the
appearance of composure, and would not open his lips, till he believed
himself to have attained it	2846.1683
He is nothing to us, you know, and I am sure
_I_ never want to see him again	1034.3349
"And _that_ I suppose is one of your sisters	2185.3817
I was ready to die of laughter	4221.0670
It was reasonable, however, to
hope, that they would not continue long	1171.7906
Darcy, and Lizzy, and Kitty," said Mrs	547.1197

Collins made his
declaration in form	9652.2337
Whatever bears affinity to cunning is
despicable	9787.4512
My daughter and my
nephew are formed for each other	5260.7602
While settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound of the
door bell, and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its
being Colonel Fitzwilliam himself, who had once before called late in
the evening, and might now come to enquire particularly after her	1983.1943
I have been a disappointed man, and
my spirits will not bear solitude	1575.5321
"

Ring the bell,
Kitty, for Hill	4217.2980
Our
importance, our respectability in the world, must be affected by the
wild volatility, the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark
Lydia's character	3059.3455
"

She then ran gaily off, rejoicing as she rambled about, in the hope of
being at home again in a day or two	2448.4766
Darcy, that they scarcely ever saw him	1525.9347
I shall send for my
     clothes when I get to Longbourn; but I wish you would tell Sally
     to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown, before they are
     packed up	3190.0347
I know you will do him such ample justice, that I am
growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent	3246.3527
"

Mr	8837.5692
As for Wickham and Lydia, their characters suffered no revolution from
the marriage of her sisters	2800.4566
Mr	10187.8868
He took the hint,
and when Mary had finished her second song, said aloud,

"That will do extremely well, child	3343.3401
"

"Mr	2838.7048
I thought I should have broke my heart	2943.3545
Did you see him while you were at Lambton? I thought I
understood from the Gardiners that you had	2235.0489

E	10070.3375
She continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of Lady
Catherine's carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter
Charlotte's observation, and hurried her away to her room	3112.7947
Bingley with having promised on his first coming
into the country to give a ball at Netherfield	3268.0809
Kitty is slight and delicate, and Mary studies so much, that her hours
of repose should not be broken in on	3141.4191
When all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen,
they returned down stairs, and taking leave of the housekeeper, were
consigned over to the gardener, who met them at the hall door	2512.5678
Bingley, she had likewise seen for an instant, and in that short period
saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed	2843.1861
If you should have no objection to receive me
     into your house, I propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on
     you and your family, Monday, November 18th, by four o'clock, and
     shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the Saturday
     se'night following, which I can do without any inconvenience, as
     Lady Catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a
     Sunday, provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the
     duty of the day	3313.5397
The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no
otherwise than by netting a purse, or covering a skreen	6035.0176
"I would not on any
account trifle with her affectionate solicitude; or allow her to hear it
from any one but myself	2469.6378
I have a warm, unguarded temper, and I
may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion _of_ him, and _to_ him, too
freely	2451.6184
But I hope you will not mind it: it is
all for Jane's sake, you know; and there is no occasion for talking to
him, except just now and then	1429.9053
Poor
Jane! I am sorry for her, because, with her disposition, she may not get
over it immediately	1411.9448
That tall, proud man	9309.7378
Reflection must be
reserved for solitary hours; whenever she was alone, she gave way to it
as the greatest relief; and not a day went by without a solitary walk,
in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant
recollections	2821.1113
When first
he entered the corps, she was ready enough to admire him; but so we all
were	2342.4416
She had dressed with more than
usual care, and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all
that remained unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it was not more than
might be won in the course of the evening	1871.1025

their father and mother	1643.5077

"This account then is what he has received from Mr	2970.4115
Its business office is located at 809
North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887	9516.6377

"Your surprise could not be greater than _mine_ in being noticed by you	3686.0662
--That they might have met without ill consequence, is
     perhaps probable;--but his regard did not appear to me enough
     extinguished for him to see her without some danger	2878.6938

"But if he returns no more this winter, my choice will never be
required	2827.7268

very difficult	1704.3888
But the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man, whom
they had never seen before, of most gentleman-like appearance, walking
with an officer on the other side of the way	2308.8230
Mrs	10116.2240
"

"My object _then_," replied Darcy, "was to shew you, by every civility
in my power, that I was not so mean as to resent the past; and I hoped
to obtain your forgiveness, to lessen your ill opinion, by letting you
see that your reproofs had been attended to	2101.8813
When the first
transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were
over, he naturally returned to all his former indolence	4272.2957
Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving any
one; and all that I can hope in this case is, that she is deceived
herself	2151.6354
From his garden, Mr	5166.2766
Nothing could
console and nothing appease her	7574.2693
He still loves me, and we are
engaged	2277.2832
If you and Miss
Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room, I shall be very
thankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me	1706.0716
Robinson's asking him how he liked our Meryton
assemblies, and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty
women in the room, and _which_ he thought the prettiest? and his
answering immediately to the last question--Oh! the eldest Miss Bennet
beyond a doubt, there cannot be two opinions on that point	2270.5687
"I have no reason, I assure you," said he, "to be dissatisfied with my
reception	819.2849
Such relief, however, as it was in her power to afford, by the practice
of what might be called economy in her own private expences, she
frequently sent them	2027.1918
Well, if they can be easy with an
estate that is not lawfully their own, so much the better	2089.6500
"They
will join me early to-morrow," he continued, "and among them are some
who will claim an acquaintance with you,--Mr	3289.9484
The others then joined her, and expressed their admiration of his
figure; but Elizabeth heard not a word, and, wholly engrossed by her own
feelings, followed them in silence	2099.3407
That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over a
ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the assembly
brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate	3319.2767
Bennet's invention was again at work to get
every body away from him and her daughter	2996.0784
What I have to say relates to
     poor Lydia	3427.3343
It was next to impossible that their cousin should
come in a scarlet coat, and it was now some weeks since they had
received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour	2350.2389
The distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly	10235.5071
"If they had uncles enough to fill _all_ Cheapside," cried Bingley, "it
would not make them one jot less agreeable	2390.8056
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1	3026.4609
" And gravely glancing
at Mr	5675.3062
--What advantage can it be to you
to offend Mr	4209.0279
Mr	10187.8868
Miss Darcy's praise occupied
the chief of it	2576.5303
"

"Oh!--you mean Jane, I suppose--because he danced with her twice	1557.2957
"

"Yes, indeed," cried Mrs	1028.8785
Darcy's
sometimes coming there stopped her, and instead of entering the park,
she turned up the lane, which led her farther from the turnpike road	3091.8793
Lady Catherine will not think the worse of you for
being simply dressed	3097.4363
Wickham is the son of a very
     respectable man, who had for many years the management of all the
     Pemberley estates; and whose good conduct in the discharge of his
     trust, naturally inclined my father to be of service to him, and on
     George Wickham, who was his god-son, his kindness was therefore
     liberally bestowed	2184.1235
CHAPTER VII	8085.8214
Darcy is over, I presume," said Miss
Bingley;--"and pray what is the result?"

"I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr	1121.2868
Bennet, who fancied she had gained a complete
victory over him, continued her triumph	3315.9780
In no countenance was attentive
curiosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley's, in spite of the
smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its
objects; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate, and her attentions
to Mr	2850.8984
In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother's
words, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible
whisper; for to her inexpressible vexation, she could perceive that the
chief of it was overheard by Mr	2717.3776
"

"I do not believe Mrs	1047.1270
My father and mother knew nothing of that, they only felt how
imprudent a match it must be	3366.0013
On Saturday he came again	6872.0367
After
pausing on this point a considerable while, she once more continued to
read	4184.9174
This idea
lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view; the
turning past, he was immediately before them	4187.0940
"If one could but go to Brighton!" observed Mrs	1656.4617
The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently
characteristic	4090.7801
Collins for
a few moments, he asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation
were very intimately acquainted with the family of de Bourgh	2598.5985
Darcy would connect himself with a family, where to every other
objection would now be added, an alliance and relationship of the
nearest kind with the man whom he so justly scorned	3362.0564
Jane should
therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his
attention	3738.3083
London:
Printed for T	7826.5758
"

"I will not be interrupted	817.8194
_I_ never saw such capacity, and taste, and
application, and elegance, as you describe, united	2214.6197
Her tour to the Lakes
was now the object of her happiest thoughts; it was her best consolation
for all the uncomfortable hours, which the discontentedness of her
mother and Kitty made inevitable; and could she have included Jane in
the scheme, every part of it would have been perfect	2144.8486
She endeavoured to secure Jane in
her interest, but Jane with all possible mildness declined
interfering;--and Elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness and
sometimes with playful gaiety replied to her attacks	4021.9213
"

Elizabeth made no objection;--the door was then allowed to be shut, and
the carriage drove off	1854.8291
Collins and
     myself sincerely sympathise with you, and all your respectable
     family, in your present distress, which must be of the bitterest
     kind, because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove	2653.2679
She had only to say in
reply, that they had wandered about, till she was beyond her own
knowledge	1948.2780
Yet he knew to the contrary himself	3566.4249
He meant to provide for me amply,
and thought he had done it; but when the living fell, it was given
elsewhere	1903.0425
Lydia has no
brothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from my father's
behaviour, from his indolence and the little attention he has ever
seemed to give to what was going forward in his family, that _he_ would
do as little, and think as little about it, as any father could do, in
such a matter	2307.8021
Bennet," said she, "it is very hard to think that Charlotte
Lucas should ever be mistress of this house, that I should be forced to
make way for _her_, and live to see her take my place in it!"

"My dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts	1240.2495
"

Not yet, however, in spite of her disappointment in her husband, did
Mrs	1504.9889
Jane now came up	8440.1285
His pride, in that direction,
may be of service, if not to himself, to many others, for it must deter
him from such foul misconduct as I have suffered by	2245.9026
The
possibility of meeting Mr	5738.9477
For herself she was humbled; but she was proud of him	1917.8952
Mr	10187.8868
Her many attractions were again dwelt on, and Caroline
boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy, and ventured to predict
the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former
letter	3251.0108
It was over at last however	2579.3833
"

"There is some sense in what he says about the girls however; and if he
is disposed to make them any amends, I shall not be the person to
discourage him	2075.3876
Elizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused in
attending to what passed between Darcy and his companion	3816.1873
Darcy more than once, but he believes that it was left to
him _conditionally_ only	2143.8635
But I can assure the young ladies that I come
prepared to admire them	2680.4373
Philips were now productive of the most interesting
intelligence	3515.3354
"

"You judge very properly," said Mr	1925.8032
I
shall now know how to act	3213.3857
CHAPTER XV	6939.4745
But
     last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice	5500.9152
"Don't keep coughing so, Kitty, for heaven's sake! Have a little
compassion on my nerves	2989.9215
We all love to
instruct, though we can teach only what is not worth knowing	4246.5432
Forster,
the delight of Mrs	3906.9130
"

Elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was
the case, and with equal sincerity could add that she firmly believed
and rejoiced in his domestic comforts	2484.1163
Wickham, and of seeing a confirmation of every thing in Mr	1762.4052
Darcy:--but let me not interrupt you,
Sir	3620.4527
Darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter	3491.3927
With _your_
good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of
others! Affectation of candour is common enough;--one meets it every
where	2357.6268
Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr	4902.8106
The children, two girls of six and eight years old, and two
younger boys, were to be left under the particular care of their cousin
Jane, who was the general favourite, and whose steady sense and
sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every
way--teaching them, playing with them, and loving them	3156.4438
It is not to be supposed
that there was much affection in the case	1127.8065
"

This letter gave Elizabeth some pain; but her spirits returned as she
considered that Jane would no longer be duped, by the sister at least	3084.2493
She had
gained her point, and had time to consider of it	2152.4482
There
could not exist in the world _two_ men, over whom Mr	3473.3307
II	10071.8984
"

"No--why should he? If it was not allowable for him to gain _my_
affections, because I had no money, what occasion could there be for
making love to a girl whom he did not care about, and who was equally
poor?"

"But there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her, so
soon after this event	2378.3753
But he found, in reply to
     this question, that Wickham still cherished the hope of more
     effectually making his fortune by marriage, in some other country	3378.2665
--How it could occur a second time therefore was
very odd!--Yet it did, and even a third	3166.9207
I roused, and
interested you, because I was so unlike _them_	2462.0008
--He carved, and ate, and praised with delighted
alacrity; and every dish was commended, first by him, and then by Sir
William, who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son in law
said, in a manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear	2664.6683
In the hall they parted	3733.7014
It makes me very nervous and poorly, to be thwarted
so in my own family, and to have neighbours who think of themselves
before anybody else	2915.1592
But will they make you happy?"

"Have you any other objection," said Elizabeth, "than your belief of my
indifference?"

"None at all	2550.7764
By many significant looks and silent
entreaties, did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of
complaisance,--but in vain; Mary would not understand them; such an
opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her, and she began her song	3248.6195
You deserve no such attention	6550.0884
Perhaps I am not doing her justice	3151.2846
But, alas! the story which followed of his designs on Miss Darcy,
received some confirmation from what had passed between Colonel
Fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before; and at last she was
referred for the truth of every particular to Colonel Fitzwilliam
himself--from whom she had previously received the information of his
near concern in all his cousin's affairs, and whose character she had no
reason to question	1379.8293
Jane listened with astonishment and concern;--she
knew not how to believe that Mr	3696.9161
They repulsed
every attempt of Mrs	7948.8382
Darcy, however, should
have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough, and
she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman, or
the insolent smiles of the ladies, were more intolerable	1867.4192
She was afraid of talking longer of his
friend; and, having nothing else to say, was now determined to leave the
trouble of finding a subject to him	1828.0714
"He is as fine a fellow," said Mr	2184.4376
"

Miss Bingley made no answer; and soon afterwards got up and walked about
the room	1918.8188
Are you quite sure that you feel what you ought
to do?"

"Oh, yes! You will only think I feel _more_ than I ought to do, when I
tell you all	1631.6152
That he is
as false and deceitful, as he is insinuating	2529.0389
If I were not afraid of judging harshly, I should
     be almost tempted to say, that there is a strong appearance of
     duplicity in all this	1940.1552
They soon outstripped the others, and when they had
reached the carriage, Mr	2010.3897
The business was therefore soon settled	7618.6314
"

"I think you said she was a widow, sir? has she any family?"

"She has one only daughter, the heiress of Rosings, and of very
extensive property	1208.3960
A fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de
Bourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant; and the respect which he
felt for her high rank, and his veneration for her as his patroness,
mingling with a very good opinion of himself, of his authority as a
clergyman, and his rights as a rector, made him altogether a mixture of
pride and obsequiousness, self-importance and humility	2650.5552
"They have both," said she, "been deceived, I dare say, in some way or
other, of which we can form no idea	1644.8197
He had found the law a most unprofitable study,
     and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained, if I would
     present him to the living in question--of which he trusted there
     could be little doubt, as he was well assured that I had no other
     person to provide for, and I could not have forgotten my revered
     father's intentions	2086.1010
Mrs	10116.2240
The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States	5179.3033
Darcy just deigned to return	6941.1398
Their reception from Mr	6557.0384
Gardiner? He has been here
this half hour, and master has had a letter	1153.9550
He is rich, to be
sure, and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than Jane	2168.3591
Reynolds
was of no trifling nature	6769.2448
You have no compassion on my poor nerves	3700.7024
CHAPTER V	10089.3857
The church _ought_ to have been my profession--I
was brought up for the church, and I should at this time have been in
possession of a most valuable living, had it pleased the gentleman we
were speaking of just now	2271.5952
Accordingly, when she retired at night, she asked the chambermaid
whether Pemberley were not a very fine place, what was the name of its
proprietor, and with no little alarm, whether the family were down for
the summer	2563.7436
Mr	10187.8868
Bingley was by no means deficient,
but Darcy was clever	2505.4727
This is my advice	4386.9921
Why does she not come in?"

"Oh! Charlotte says, she hardly ever does	2065.5385
In anticipating the happiness of Bingley,
which of course was to be inferior only to his own, he continued the
conversation till they reached the house	1961.2021
I should be sorry, you know,
to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in Derbyshire	1441.0238
I cannot find
out that I hate her at all, or that I am in the least unwilling to think
her a very good sort of girl	1200.7441
I really do not think Georgiana
Darcy has her equal for beauty, elegance, and accomplishments; and the
affection she inspires in Louisa and myself, is heightened into
something still more interesting, from the hope we dare to entertain of
her being hereafter our sister	3622.5867
and
Mrs	4405.4623
Darcy, who never looks at any
woman but to see a blemish, and who probably never looked at _you_ in
his life! It is admirable!"

Elizabeth tried to join in her father's pleasantry, but could only force
one most reluctant smile	2313.3442
They will have nothing else to
do	2863.5845
Had she merely _dined_ with him, she might
only have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you must
remember that four evenings have been also spent together--and four
evenings may do a great deal	2784.4331
"

"But if you have got them to-day," said Elizabeth, "my mother's purpose
will be answered	1421.8886
"

"Mr	2838.7048
As her successor in that house, she
regarded her with jealous abhorrence	4323.0942
When the engagement was for home, some of the officers always
made part of it, of which officers Mr	2498.6167
--Pray, what is your age?"

"With three younger sisters grown up," replied Elizabeth smiling, "your
Ladyship can hardly expect me to own it	1555.1430
He spoke of it as a certain event,
     of which the time alone could be undecided	2348.4654
"She is so fond of Mrs	2683.6925
But whatever may be the sentiments which Mr	4138.8370
Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabeth
again, having still a great deal to say to her, and many enquiries to
make after all their Hertfordshire friends	2310.0561
The Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the
world, though only a few weeks before, when Lydia had first run away,
they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune	2331.4459
"

Then, perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying, she added,
"Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia, we may draw from it this useful
lesson; that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable--that one false
step involves her in endless ruin--that her reputation is no less
brittle than it is beautiful,--and that she cannot be too much guarded
in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex	3052.7379
She felt that she had no business at
Pemberley, and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it	2167.8583
In this danger Kitty
is also comprehended	7984.4327
Recovering himself, however, shortly,
he turned to his partner, and said,

"Sir William's interruption has made me forget what we were talking of	2230.0826
Collins was first introduced to her
notice, but he certainly has not known her long	3054.2740
Bingley's attentions to her sister, Elizabeth
was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some
interest in the eyes of his friend	1615.7993
In Three Volumes	6123.9580
Darcy with him, and sat down
again by her sister	1000.9380
I must confess myself
     surprised by your application; I did not expect it from _you_	2963.4393
"While Mary is adjusting her ideas," he continued, "let us return to Mr	2959.9636
One seems so forlorn without them	10192.1501
"

"Indeed you are mistaken	1989.5331
With assumed tranquillity he then replied, "I have no wish of denying
that I did every thing in my power to separate my friend from your
sister, or that I rejoice in my success	1955.1808
"

Mr	8837.5692
Darcy were by no means over	3736.9180
Bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for Lydia's
interruption, and promised that it should not occur again, if he would
resume his book; but Mr	2514.7216
Mr	10187.8868
Darcy; the latter of whom, however,
could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of _her_, in spite of
all Miss Bingley's witticisms on _fine eyes_	1958.8938
"

Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it, and
they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put
an end to cards; and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr	2181.6303
Wickham is safe	6428.1079
--Your mother will never see you
again if you do _not_ marry Mr	3856.1072
But perhaps Mr	7361.2938
Darcy had at first scarcely
allowed her to be pretty; he had looked at her without admiration at the
ball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise	2006.9768
All the world are good and agreeable
in your eyes	5517.6520
gutenberg	10073.4590
--Miss Darcy, the daughter of Mr	1987.9688
E	10070.3375
Bennet rejoiced to see Jane
in undiminished beauty; and more than once during dinner did Mr	3683.9247
Collins for the knowledge of what carriages went
along, and how often especially Miss De Bourgh drove by in her phaeton,
which he never failed coming to inform them of, though it happened
almost every day	2872.6126
Into _one_ house in this
neighbourhood, they shall never have admittance	3746.8402
Darcy had been at her
sister's wedding	1166.0592
These
were the contents:

     "MY DEAR HARRIET,

     "You will laugh when you know where I am gone, and I cannot help
     laughing myself at your surprise to-morrow morning, as soon as I am
     missed	1888.2857
So imprudent a
     match on both sides!--But I am willing to hope the best, and that
     his character has been misunderstood	2255.5087
She answered in the affirmative, and, unable to resist
the temptation, added, "When you met us there the other day, we had just
been forming a new acquaintance	2996.4320
Bennet, was not so well pleased with it	1224.8956
My dear Jane, Mr	1660.7732
I must find Mr	4465.5570
My courage always rises with every attempt to
intimidate me	7195.7670
GARDINER	10071.8984
Her father was walking about the room, looking grave and anxious	3298.6754
Pray go to see them, with Sir William and Maria	2134.8292
Such very
superior dancing is not often seen	4771.8302
Bennet's expectations were fully answered	6926.6767
Jenkinson was
arranging Miss de Bourgh's foot-stool, that she said, 'Mr	2809.9533
"You either chuse this method of passing
the evening because you are in each other's confidence and have secret
affairs to discuss, or because you are conscious that your figures
appear to the greatest advantage in walking;--if the first, I should be
completely in your way;--and if the second, I can admire you much better
as I sit by the fire	3034.3884
"

But Jane could think with certainty on only one point,--that Mr	3734.7990
Collins and Lizzy	7264.5203
"

"No," said Colonel Fitzwilliam, "that is an advantage which he must
divide with me	1411.3380
Believe her to be deceived by all means	2526.9187
gutenberg	10073.4590
I have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will
include you and my sister Maria in every invitation with which she
honours us during your stay here	4131.1191
"

"Nay, if you are so serious about it, I shall consider the matter as
absolutely settled	2061.9088
"

"It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire	1907.4428
I cannot think of it without abhorrence	1159.6655
Collins met for breakfast a few
minutes before the others appeared; and he took the opportunity of
paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary	3794.1991
--"Louisa, you will not mind my
waking Mr	2856.7835
"

Mrs	8806.4321
"Do
you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on
them, as nonsense? I cannot quite agree with you _there_	2439.1221
Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday; on Tuesday, his wife received a
letter from him; it told them, that on his arrival, he had immediately
found out his brother, and persuaded him to come to Gracechurch street	2271.2557
With a
book he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had a
good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised
such splendid expectations	2394.2006
But
Lizzy, you have been very sly, very reserved with me	2246.3683
They have at
least that advantage	4595.9824
As soon as they entered the copse, Lady Catherine began in the following
manner:--

"You can be at no loss, Miss Bennet, to understand the reason of my
journey hither	2100.9487
Bennet
was restored to her usual querulous serenity, and by the middle of June
Kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton without
tears; an event of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth hope, that by
the following Christmas, she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to
mention an officer above once a day, unless by some cruel and malicious
arrangement at the war-office, another regiment should be quartered in
Meryton	3053.3489
Collins, was convinced that
they were talking of the Longbourn estate, and resolving to turn herself
and her daughters out of the house, as soon as Mr	1173.8017
F	10070.3375
Indeed, Mr	3641.3274
Elizabeth soon heard from her friend; and their
correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been; that it
should be equally unreserved was impossible	2743.8602
It was
generally evident whenever they met, that he _did_ admire her; and to
_her_ it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference
which she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a
way to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that it
was not likely to be discovered by the world in general, since Jane
united with great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and a
uniform cheerfulness of manner, which would guard her from the
suspicions of the impertinent	1890.1310
E	10070.3375
But in all, and in almost every line of each, there was a want of that
cheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style, and which,
proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself, and kindly
disposed towards every one, had been scarcely ever clouded	2265.0819
"

"Insolent girl!" said Elizabeth to herself	1112.2208
Your
     father was gone, your uncle at home, and, as I said before, they
     had a great deal of talk together	1568.6389

Her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what
she did not believe herself, that his attentions to Jane had been merely
the effect of a common and transient liking, which ceased when he saw
her no more; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at
the time, she had the same story to repeat every day	2092.9816
"

"You have a very small park here," returned Lady Catherine after a short
silence	1842.6083
The family were assembled in the breakfast room, to receive
them	2418.6125
She was met in the vestibule by Lydia, who, flying to
her, cried in a half whisper, "I am glad you are come, for there is such
fun here!--What do you think has happened this morning?--Mr	1967.9229
Darcy," observed Miss Bingley, in a half whisper,
"that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine
eyes	2309.4112
I have known him
too long and too well to be a fair judge	2745.4781
He shall not be in love with me, if I
can prevent it	1220.2712
Bennet, and
we shall very soon settle it with her, I am sure	889.4493
Mr	10187.8868
Darcy's explanation
_there_, had appeared very insufficient; and she read it again	2571.9541
That among his own connections he was
esteemed and valued--that even Wickham had allowed him merit as a
brother, and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of
his sister as to prove him capable of _some_ amiable feeling	2983.9346
"I am by no means of opinion, I assure you," said he, "that a ball of
this kind, given by a young man of character, to respectable people, can
have any evil tendency; and I am so far from objecting to dancing myself
that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins
in the course of the evening, and I take this opportunity of soliciting
yours, Miss Elizabeth, for the two first dances especially,--a
preference which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right
cause, and not to any disrespect for her	1634.0229
Do let me ask my partner to introduce you	5722.7359
Jane was already so much recovered
as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening	4059.5710
"

"I beg your pardon	1854.2945
Any thing beyond
the very neighbourhood of Longbourn, I suppose, would appear far	2935.6497
It settled the matter; and they pursued the accustomed
circuit; which brought them again, after some time, in a descent among
hanging woods, to the edge of the water, in one of its narrowest parts	2564.6271

But how came you to tell us that he was so
disagreeable?"

Elizabeth excused herself as well as she could; said that she had liked
him better when they met in Kent than before, and that she had never
seen him so pleasant as this morning	1446.9505
She has two nieces
of her own	2690.5089
Darcy is so violent,
that it would be the death of half the good people in Meryton, to
attempt to place him in an amiable light	2161.8613
Mr	10187.8868
There was certainly at this moment, in Elizabeth's mind, a more gentle
sensation towards the original, than she had ever felt in the height of
their acquaintance	2364.0806
What sister would think
herself at liberty to do it, unless there were something very
objectionable? If they believed him attached to me, they would not try
to part us; if he were so, they could not succeed	3383.9754

"No," replied Jane, "I have not forgotten him; but I have nothing

But she had never felt so
strongly as now, the disadvantages which must attend the children of so
unsuitable a marriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils
arising from so ill-judged a direction of talents; talents which rightly
used, might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters,
even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife	4374.5865

Darcy soon drew the attention
of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien; and
the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after
his entrance, of his having ten thousand a year	3048.3783
Darcy before they
had known any thing of the matter	1702.6323
I happened to overhear the
gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of
this house the names of his cousin Miss de Bourgh, and of her mother
Lady Catherine	2474.9559
Jenkinson to make up her
party	5052.2746
Bennet, with great civility, begged her ladyship to take some
refreshment; but Lady Catherine very resolutely, and not very politely,
declined eating any thing; and then rising up, said to Elizabeth,

"Miss Bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness
on one side of your lawn	1829.0901
He is come--Mr	4530.2706

Whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing
her, she could not tell, but he certainly had not seen her with
composure	1873.0166
--Come, Kitty, I want you up stairs	3445.2383
He was writing, and, without raising his head,
coolly replied,

"Just as you please	2171.7497
She dared not
even mention that gentleman	5745.3940

of the pictures, the dimensions of the rooms, and the price of the
furniture, in vain	1688.5094
Miss
Bingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the
first opportunity of saying, with sneering civility,

"Pray, Miss Eliza, are not the ----shire militia removed from Meryton?
They must be a great loss to _your_ family	1860.1317

"I have no right to give _my_ opinion," said Wickham, "as to his being

agreeable	6101.6574
You may depend upon my seeking no further	4690.5155
I can remember no symptom of affection on either
side; and had any thing of the kind been perceptible, you must be aware
that ours is not a family, on which it could be thrown away	1946.3395
Elizabeth's collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emotion; and
as Miss Bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not approach nearer to
Wickham, Georgiana also recovered in time, though not enough to be able
to speak any more	2644.3732

Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to
supper; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the
others, and she had no opportunity of detaining them	2395.2078
"

"My dear Jane!" exclaimed Elizabeth, "you are too good	650.9671
She had a sister married to a Mr	3062.2677
Could he expect that her friends
would not step forward? Could he expect to be noticed again by the
regiment, after such an affront to Colonel Forster? His temptation is
not adequate to the risk	3000.2290
But they were entirely ignorant of what had passed; and their raptures
continued with little intermission to the very day of Lydia's leaving
home	2669.6899

     as, upon the whole, I hope will give you satisfaction	2379.3530

altogether; Mr	4178.9527
Happy shall I be, when his stay at Netherfield is over!"

"I wish I could say any thing to comfort you," replied Elizabeth; "but
it is wholly out of my power	2397.7028
Her answer, therefore, was not propitious, at
least not to Elizabeth's wishes, for she was impatient to get home	1621.4959
"It was greatly my wish that he should do so," he added, "as soon
     as his marriage was fixed on	1561.3113
You refuse, then, to oblige me	3472.4011
Gardiner and
her niece, however, did her justice, and pitied her	2309.3073
Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield
party	3805.0056
That _she_ could
be in any danger from the deception never entered my head	3926.7013
"He
only told me, what I have now told you	2061.6648
From something that he told me in
our journey hither, I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted to
him	2665.2903
Once or twice she could discern a faint blush; but in general
Charlotte wisely did not hear	3957.3235
"

It was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that embarrassment,
from which she had been so wholly free at first	1865.6295
Though I
_know_ it must be a scandalous falsehood; though I would not injure him
so much as to suppose the truth of it possible, I instantly resolved on
setting off for this place, that I might make my sentiments known to
you	2359.6038
He even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity	3010.6093
And now nothing
remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the
violence of my affection	2877.6735
Darcy then
was	7097.9595
_I_ should be
ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me	3803.1540
Her dirty petticoat
quite escaped my notice	10138.0212
And
     will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances
     to his creditors in Meryton, of whom I shall subjoin a list,
     according to his information	3999.3456
He had entertained hopes of being
admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he had heard
much; but he saw only the father	2483.0279
Perhaps I
did not always love him so well as I do now	1939.9814
But I am particularly
attached to these young men; and know them to be so much attached to
me!--They were excessively sorry to go! But so they always are	1645.8241
Lady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew;
and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character, in
her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement, she sent him
language so very abusive, especially of Elizabeth, that for some time
all intercourse was at an end	2316.5807
"

Consoled by this resolution, she was the better able to bear her
husband's incivility; though it was very mortifying to know that her
neighbours might all see Mr	2676.3205
All that is known after this is, that they were seen
     to continue the London road	2983.3125
"Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs	1354.0968
Very little was said by either; Kitty was
too much afraid of him to talk; Elizabeth was secretly forming a
desperate resolution; and perhaps he might be doing the same	3248.2656
They were ignorant, idle, and vain	2710.4557
Miss Bingley's letter arrived, and put an end to doubt	1878.3732
Could she have seen half as much love in Mr	4969.2505
Mrs	10116.2240
"

"What think you of books?" said he, smiling	1381.2938
They
had all been very ill-used since she last saw her sister	4447.1337
Bennet gone away, and I know he will fight
Wickham, wherever he meets him, and then he will be killed, and what is
to become of us all? The Collinses will turn us out, before he is cold
in his grave; and if you are not kind to us, brother, I do not know what
we shall do	1515.2560
"

Elizabeth's misery increased, at such unnecessary, such officious
attention! Were the same fair prospect to arise at present, as had
flattered them a year ago, every thing, she was persuaded, would be
hastening to the same vexatious conclusion	3402.4719
Darcy's behaviour astonished and vexed her	5116.3367
Four nieces
of Mrs	8455.4296
Every body is disgusted with his pride	4936.7342
Their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she could
regard with any complacency	1601.0261
"

"Can such abominable pride as his, have ever done him good?"

"Yes	2936.6576
The whole of what Elizabeth had already
heard, his claims on Mr	3068.6041
"

"I did not think you would;--and that being the case, I cannot consider
your situation with much compassion	1453.7311
"

But Elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with them,
laughingly answered,

"No, no; stay where you are	1948.5703
"

Elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he afterwards
took occasion to ask her, when unattended to by any of the rest,
whether _all_ her sisters were at Longbourn	2464.1091
--But
     from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally
     bestowed, respecting each circumstance, I shall hope to be in
     future secured, when the following account of my actions and their
     motives has been read	3246.6575
CHAPTER X	8085.8214
"There
is nothing the matter with me	2891.3057
At first there
seemed danger of Lydia's engrossing him entirely, for she was a most
determined talker; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets,
she soon grew too much interested in the game, too eager in making bets
and exclaiming after prizes, to have attention for any one in
particular	3374.8415
Bennet, "you
will wait on him of course	1551.1381
--Oh! had I known what
I ought, what I dared, to do! But I knew not--I was afraid of doing too
much	417.8322
A
most delightful place!--Excellent Parsonage House! It would have suited
me in every respect	4056.6319
--Pursuing her way along the lane, she then began it	4655.2945
Bennet, have you no more lanes
hereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her way again to-day?"

"I advise Mr	2811.4580
With the kindest concern he
     came on to Longbourn, and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner
     most creditable to his heart	3502.6634
"

"I am talking of possibilities, Charles	2389.8512
She now lost every expectation of pleasure	5768.8770
"

"Yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near Cheapside	2186.8444
They contained no actual complaint, nor was there any
revival of past occurrences, or any communication of present suffering	6570.9030
"

"I must think your language too strong in speaking of both," replied
Jane, "and I hope you will be convinced of it, by seeing them happy
together	1538.7787
' Allow me, by the
way, to observe, my fair cousin, that I do not reckon the notice and
kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the
advantages in my power to offer	1873.7486
The recollection of what I
then said, of my conduct, my manners, my expressions during the whole of
it, is now, and has been many months, inexpressibly painful to me	1894.2256
His behaviour to myself has been
scandalous; but I verily believe I could forgive him any thing and every
thing, rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory
of his father	3353.4998
"

Another intreaty that she would be serious, however, produced the
desired effect; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn assurances of
attachment	2782.6265
Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so--but still they admired
her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and one whom
they should not object to know more of	1778.9564
I depend on you for that	4253.8985
Elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had, from the distress of
the moment, been led to make Mr	1967.8156
Darcy?"

"As much as I ever wish to be," cried Elizabeth warmly,--"I have spent
four days in the same house with him, and I think him very
disagreeable	250.8482
Bennet," as she entered the room, "we have had a most
delightful evening, a most excellent ball	1443.7405
"

Her performance was pleasing, though by no means capital	3699.1926
Elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her
delight in the prospect of their relationship	3525.7014
"I have found out," said he, "by a singular accident, that there is now
in the room a near relation of my patroness	1358.4637
She had scarcely needed her
present observation to be satisfied, from the reason of things, that
their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love, rather
than by his; and she would have wondered why, without violently caring
for her, he chose to elope with her at all, had she not felt certain
that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances; and
if that were the case, he was not the young man to resist an opportunity
of having a companion	2102.8051
What made you so shy of me, when you first
called, and afterwards dined here? Why, especially, when you called, did
you look as if you did not care about me?"

"Because you were grave and silent, and gave me no encouragement	2393.2306
"

Elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement, but was too much oppressed to
make any reply	3075.0766
Denny had
brought him from London, and that he was to have a lieutenant's
commission in the ----shire	1246.7458
He began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too much attention	4213.4214
Never mind Miss
Lizzy's hair	9452.7076
E	10070.3375
Your tempers are by no means unlike	5063.4123
She answered him with cold civility	4729.3147
Darcy they had
only seen at church	5039.4608
How you must have hated me after _that_ evening?"

"Hate you! I was angry perhaps at first, but my anger soon began to take
a proper direction	2341.5797
Collins,
was a most humiliating picture!--And to the pang of a friend disgracing
herself and sunk in her esteem, was added the distressing conviction
that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot
she had chosen	2441.0159
But as to your
other objection, I am afraid it will hardly hold good	2098.0829
But Jane and Elizabeth, who
agreed in wishing, for the sake of their sister's feelings and
consequence, that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents,
urged him so earnestly, yet so rationally and so mildly, to receive her
and her husband at Longbourn, as soon as they were married, that he was
prevailed on to think as they thought, and act as they wished	1873.3082
His revenge would have been complete indeed	3376.1574
"

She did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses
were engaged	3491.8117
When they repaired to the
dining-room, Elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether Bingley would take
the place, which, in all their former parties, had belonged to him, by
her sister	1944.3070

And pray, Lizzy, what said Lady Catherine
about this report? Did she call to refuse her consent?"

To this question his daughter replied only with a laugh; and as it had
been asked without the least suspicion, she was not distressed by his
repeating it	2458.4387
"My dear Madam," he replied, "this invitation is particularly
gratifying, because it is what I have been hoping to receive; and you
may be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon as
possible	1410.8509
Philips was always glad to see her nieces, and the two eldest, from

place?"

"I cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the words, which
laid the foundation	2054.0048
Hurst and Miss Bingley, and the lady with whom she lived in
London	1330.5141
The looks and behaviour of every body they had seen were
discussed, except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention	3776.1556
And to be kept back on _such_ a motive!--I think it
would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of
mind	2460.4474
It would have been strange if they had	1853.0099
"

"I should never have considered the distance as one of the _advantages_
of the match," cried Elizabeth	1416.0020
What
could be more natural than his asking you again? He could not help
seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in
the room	2642.1120
Mr	10187.8868
One cannot wonder that so
very fine a young man, with family, fortune, every thing in his favour,
should think highly of himself	2507.2611
"

"It is well	1581.3460
You blamed me for coming?"

"No indeed; I felt nothing but surprise	1795.0996
Bennet and
the children	2838.3397
Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily
attached to her situation, that she could, upon the whole, have no cause
to repine	2470.9809
Darcy was attending them to their
carriage, Miss Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on
Elizabeth's person, behaviour, and dress	3053.9416
The united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters
and of his overpowering friend, assisted by the attractions of Miss
Darcy and the amusements of London, might be too much, she feared, for
the strength of his attachment	2261.9597
"

"Sir, you quite misunderstand me," said Mrs	1520.9565
He knows where we live	7319.0855
--I
am excessively attentive to all those things	2729.6177
"

"I never can be thankful, Mr	1879.8415
Did you see it?"

Bingley replied that he did, and made his congratulations	810.3190
Elizabeth had mentioned her
name to her mother, on her ladyship's entrance, though no request of
introduction had been made	2229.1763
Let me recommend you, however, as a friend,
not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions; for as to Mr	1742.7834
But I am at his disposal	1791.5239
